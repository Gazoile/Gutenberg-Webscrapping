                          INTRODUCTION

                     THE FRENCH REVOLUTION


_Madame Th�r�se_ is a story of the French Revolution. The events
described in it occur between the summer of 1793 and the following
spring. It abounds in allusions to episodes in the Revolution itself and
contains many references to customs which owed their origin to the
Revolution. Though it presents no difficulties to the intelligent
Frenchman, still, by the constant introduction of these allusions to
events and institutions of the Revolution, it refers to many things
which are not clear to readers of other nations, unless they are
familiar with the leading facts of French history preceding the
revolutionary outbreak. The following sections contain an account of
many things mentioned in Madame Th�r�se.

1. The French Revolution was the culmination of the revolt of the French
people against royal despotism and class privilege. The spectacular part
of the Revolution began in 1789, the real revolution was complete before
that date. In 1786 the king, Louis XVI, called together the ancient
representative and legislative body of the nation to ascertain whether
the members could suggest any means of securing the great and constantly
increasing sums of money which he thought necessary for maintaining an
extravagant court--and incidentally the government.

2. If the king was compelled as a last resort to summon this ancient
legislative body, called the Estates General, the financial condition of
the government must have been bad indeed; for the Estates General had
not met for two centuries. It was unable to devise any increase in
taxation which the people could bear, for the poorer classes were
already taxed to the utmost and the upper classes were unwilling to tax
themselves. The Estates General, therefore, was not able to plan ways
and means of increasing the income of the government.

3. But in this session the non-privileged part of the people had
leaders. Certain nobles and ecclesiastics, of whom Mirabeau and Abb�
Siey�s are the best known, purposely became representatives, not of the
upper classes but of the lower. Under their guidance representatives of
the Third Estate (the three estates were the Nobility, the Clergy, and
the Commons) in the Estates General now assumed power on behalf of the
French people to regulate taxation. They represented ninety-six per cent
of the population and took the name of National Assembly.

4. This was revolution. It stirred the king to assert his authority and
he directed them to adjourn. They refused. The Assembly now proceeded to
a consideration of changes in the government. The king brought soldiers
to Paris. This act of intimidation won for the Assembly the support of
the Parisian mob. One of the first acts of this mob was to destroy the
Bastille, which was the ancient state prison and a monument of royal
oppression.

5. The peasantry in France rose, and in some places demolished the
castles of the nobility. The mob brought the king from the royal
residence at Versailles to Paris, where he was kept practically a
prisoner. Thus in a few months the people had secured control of the
government, but without overthrowing the monarchy. On the fourth of
August, 1789, the National Assembly "swept away all the odious
privileges of the old regime and decreed in law the reign of equality in
France." This was the beginning of the Republic, and the people began to
call themselves Republicans. Later, income-producing church
lands--perhaps one-fifth of the area of the country--were confiscated
and the Church was made a department of the state.

6. But the National Assembly needed money, so it issued paper called
_assignats_, whose value was secured by these church lands. This money
was subsequently issued in such large quantities that a dollar of it
came to be worth only a quarter of a cent. It was finally repudiated
altogether.

7. From 1791, the history of the Revolution is a recital of factious
quarrels, and of wars with the rest of Europe. These latter did not
cease until the battle of Waterloo, in 1815.

8. European sovereigns watched the progress of the Revolution with
anxiety. No people would have the same respect for monarchy and kingly
authority, if the French were successful in overthrowing their
government. Kings made common cause against the common danger and
resolved to crush this uprising in France. Frederick William II, King of
Prussia, Emperor Leopold II of Austria and his successor Francis II were
the first to make war on the French. The French armies were so badly
beaten at first that the mob in Paris believed that those around the
king were giving information to the enemy. They accordingly made the
king an actual prisoner to prevent further betrayals. Thereupon the Duke
of Brunswick, in command of the Prussian army on the borders of France,
issued a proclamation threatening destruction to Paris if harm should be
done to the French king. Straightway the mob attacked the palace in
which the king was prisoner and massacred the Swiss guards. This was on
the tenth of August, 1792, a memorable day in the history of France.

9. On the twentieth of September the battle of Valmy was fought, in
which the French defeated their enemies decisively. The next day the
Republic was formally established, and on the twenty-second began Year
One of the French Republic. In the January following, the king was
executed. Prussia, Austria, England, Holland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal,
the Holy See, and Russia now combined to crush the young republic and
restore monarchy. La Vend�e, one of the western districts of France,
rose against the radical changes introduced by the Revolution.

10. The National Assembly was succeeded by the Convention, among whose
members dissensions arose and produced the Reign of Terror, from June to
October, 1793. Among the excesses of this period was the abolition of
the Christian religion in France and the substitution therefor of the
worship of the Goddess of Reason.

11. The causes which led the French people to rise and overthrow its
oppressors are fivefold:

(_a_). A despotic government. Over a century before the Revolution,
Louis XIV had said, "_L'�tat, c'est moi_." In his opinion the people
existed merely for him to tax, and despise in exact proportion to the
burdens which they bore. His successors held the same doctrine. For
nearly two centuries no king had summoned the national legislative body
to make laws and lay taxes. Successive kings had, by royal decree,
enacted such laws as they had seen fit, and had enforced them as they
pleased. They arrested, imprisoned, and executed citizens, almost as
they wished. Their taxation was extravagant, for the most part
unnecessary, unreasonable, and brutal. They lived scandalous lives
utterly regardless of their responsibility to their people. Their courts
were notorious for extravagance, frivolity and vice.

(_b_). Another cause was a contemptible nobility. In profligacy the
nobles imitated the kings. They despised their people, and robbed them
of the little left by the king's tax collectors. They had many ancient
feudal privileges but were unwilling to relinquish any of them to help
the people. The nobility, like the clergy, on the pretext of saving
their dignity exempted themselves from the necessity of paying taxes.

(_c_). The clergy. It has sometimes happened that oppression of the
people by religious organizations has been commensurate with the tyranny
of the ruling classes. On this account the oppressors representing
religion have been despised by the people, quite as much as lay tyrants.
The higher clergy, who were lords over nearly one fifth of the land of
France, did not treat their vassals appreciably better than did the
nobility. During the violence at the outbreak of the Revolution the
people in some parts of France burned castles, churches, and monasteries
alike. As Erckmann and Chatrian say in another work, "The peasants were
weary of monasteries and ch�teaux; they wished to till the fields for
themselves."

(_d_). The condition of the people. The life, liberty, and property of
the peasant were at the mercy of the king and the upper classes. Yet the
condition of the peasant was not utterly bad. He seems to have been
oppressed because he was not intelligent enough to better himself.

(_e_). Taxation. It was a recognized principle of the French government,
that the people might be forced to pay taxes and to build roads at
pleasure. If the peasant did not pay taxes by the time appointed,
collectors went to his home and seized whatever would satisfy the claim,
even taking clothes laid on bushes to dry, and sometimes going so far as
to remove doors from their hinges, or to take beams and boards from the
buildings and carry them away in place of taxes.

The salt tax (_la gabelle_) was an odious burden in its lack of
uniformity. It was thirty times as high in some parts of France as it
was in others. Besides, every person had to buy seven pounds a year for
household use; this salt could not be devoted to any other use. A
peasant needing salt for other purposes was forced to buy other salt, on
which there was of course a tax. To all the nobility, however, the king
made an annual free distribution of salt.

The _corv�e_, or forced contribution to build roads, was an oppressive
and tyrannical tax. Public good may have required community of labor on
roads, but the later abuse by which royal officers "tore away poor
peasants from their families and work, and drove them off to build
roads" was not to be endured. While building roads peasants had only
what food they brought along or what they begged out of working hours.

Louis Blanc makes the peasant soliloquize thus under the
pre-Revolutionary taxation:

"They condemn me to work without pay. My family counts on my work in the
field, but they take me away and force me to level the highway under
coach wheels, under the feet of the trader or the priest or the elegant
gentleman. I don't know how to surface roads; yet they take no account
of my ignorance and if my work is ill-done, they will come in a few
months and take my time to repair it. I am a human being, yet they treat
me with a harshness which oxen and mules are spared. I pay a tax that
the nobility and clergy may be exempt; and they make me break stone on
the road for them, profiting by it without even being grateful to me.
They make me buy salt at twelve cents a pound; they rob me on tobacco;
they billet soldiers on me; and when I give them a whole week of my
work, they don't pay me; if any of my animals die of fatigue while
working for them, they never reimburse me. If I am maimed in their
service, they brutally thrust me out on a charitable public."

Peasants were not allowed to enclose fields; and sometimes they were
forbidden the necessary practice of agriculture, lest it might drive the
game from the neighborhood or in some other way interfere with the
lord's hunting. In seasons of bountiful crops peasants fared badly; but
in years when crops failed, death and starvation walked through the
land; so that the good F�nelon said to his king, "France is simply a
large hospital, full of woe and empty of food." This picture is perhaps
too dark and is hardly a fair presentation of the condition of French
peasantry.

(_f_). The trend of French philosophy. Many writers in France, among
them Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, d'Alembert, and Abb� Bergier, were
publishing new doctrines about the rights of man and about government.
Their teachings were too advanced for the France of the Bourbon kings.
These philosophers did much to stimulate thought and discussion in the
field of government and politics. Thus they prepared the minds of many
for the steps that led to the Revolution. They did much to create the
discontent which led the French people to assume and exercise the rights
that were their own, though the result was the overthrow of established
government and the downfall of kings.

(_g_). The success of the American Revolution, 1776-1783. Across the sea
the Americans had resented and resisted tyranny and oppression; this
fact was all the better known because of French interest, sympathy, and
assistance. Thus the French found a recent precedent for their own
attempt to overthrow a tyrannical government and establish a republic.


                        ERCKMANN AND CHATRIAN

Erckmann and Chatrian, or Erckmann-Chatrian, as the French write this
collaborative name, were two authors whose joint productions were at
first short stories, and later a series of historical romances which
made their fame. In these they confined their efforts to themes
suggested by the history of their own country, France. The scenes are
for the most part laid in localities which they themselves
knew--especially the Alsace of their youth. Their best characters are
from classes of their beloved people with whom they had lived, and whose
virtues and faults were to them as open books. The chosen time of most
of their romances is the period of the French Revolution, and the
purpose--for they wrote with a purpose--is the glorification of peace
and the universal brotherhood of man.

They had several successes in the dramatic field also, some of their
plays being cordially received not only in France but in other
countries. Their play called _Alsace_ was intensely patriotic, and
pleased the people, whenever a despotic government allowed it to be
presented. Their _Juif Polonais_, or "The Bells", as it is known in
English, has been on the stage for nearly forty years, and enjoys a
great popularity yet. Probably no play in Sir Henry Irving's repertory
was received with the same steady favor or was acted so many times by
him.

�MILE ERCKMANN was born at Phalsbourg, a fortified town of Alsace on the
border between Germany and France, May 20, 1822. His father was a poor
shopkeeper and as late as 1870 continued to serve his customers. The
younger Erckmann received his education at the local college, but only
after a hard struggle. Like the others who find the road to knowledge
arduous he made good use of his opportunities, after he had once
obtained them. He was at the head of every class of which he was a
member and was graduated with first honors. So remarkable a student had
he been--though his native ability was only fair--that for years he was
mentioned by the professors as a model worthy of close imitation. Born
and reared among a population which was essentially German, in spite of
the most persistent efforts to denationalize it, he had German
characteristics of body as well as of mind. He had a heavy frame, golden
hair and beard, a rather broad face, blue eyes, fair complexion, and a
meditative expression, all of which would easily cause him to be taken
almost anywhere for a professor from a German university rather than for
the Frenchman which he really was. He combined Alsatian-French vivacity
with German method and minuteness; yet he hated the Germans, though he
was German in name and characteristics.

After finishing his course at Phalsbourg he went to Paris to study law,
following this work intermittently for fifteen years. Later he revisited
the old college at Phalsbourg. Here he heard the president lament the
fact that among the students he had only one worthy successor of
Erckmann, namely a certain Alexandre Chatrian. Chatrian was sent for and
the three dined together that evening. Erckmann was shown an article by
Chatrian bristling with novel ideas on society and its organization. He
was so well pleased by it that he immediately suggested to Chatrian the
joint establishment of a democratic paper. This paper was suppressed by
the police after eight issues.

Erckmann returned to Paris to study law, which at times he gave up for
the pursuit of literature, from which in course of time he returned to
the law. Meanwhile he and Chatrian had jointly written a play called
_Alsace_. It was presented, was successful, but was suppressed (1848).
This disappointment delayed for two years Chatrian's removal to Paris to
join Erckmann. They wrote a volume of stories, of which _L'illustre
Docteur Math�us_ was the principal one. When this volume appeared, they
were on the verge of need. The capricious public bought three editions
of the volume and gave the "name" that meant permanent fame for the
authors.

Chatrian finally reached Paris, and the collaborators wrote on busily.
In 1858-1861 they worked on subjects drawn from their usual pastoral
sources, and made from them a series of longer tales which they named
_Romans Populaires_. These were well received. Emboldened by their
steady gain in popular favor the literary partners resolved in 1861 on a
larger venture. They conceived the idea of writing a series of
historical novels under the title of _Romans Nationaux_, the subjects of
which were to be taken from the most dramatic episodes of modern French
history after the outbreak of the first Revolution. To this happy design
they became indebted for their greatest triumphs. By 1869 they had added
eight volumes to the series.

In 1869 they had ready for the stage _Le Juif Polonais_, in which the
tortures of conscience were dramatically described, and offered it to
theatrical managers. It was finally put on at the Cluny Theatre in
Paris, and met with immediate success.

There was nothing notable in their joint career from their assured
success till the rupture of their lifelong friendship in the late
eighties, an account of which is given in the next biography. After the
death of Chatrian, Erckmann continued to write successfully with all the
oldtime vigor that had characterized the work of the two. He died March
14, 1899.

ALEXANDRE CHATRIAN was born in Soldatenthal, a village near Phalsbourg,
December 18, 1826. Like Erckmann he was of an humble family, whose
members had long followed the occupation of glassmaking. Chatrian's
parents were intelligent and determined to educate their son. They
accordingly sent him to the college at Phalsbourg, where he remained
three years. Owing to business reverses his parents were unable longer
to support him in school, so they set him to glassmaking in Belgium. He
had here an unusually good opportunity to secure a part interest in the
factory, but when he came of age, he returned home, thoroughly
dissatisfied with his occupation. His parents were disappointed at his
giving up such an opportunity to establish himself in business, but he
had made up his mind that his career ought to be a literary one. By
chance there was a vacancy at that very time in the college at
Phalsbourg. The President, who had always taken an interest in him, gave
him the appointment with permission to continue his studies in the
college. So he was installed in charge of the study hall to supervise
the work of the students and assist them in their lessons. One of his
pupils has left the following account of him:--"He was of middle height
and of strong but well-proportioned build. His rich auburn hair was cut
short enough to bring out the outlines of a remarkably fine head. His
full but closely trimmed beard framed a most intellectual face. A high
forehead, large piercing eyes of brilliant black, a fine Greek nose, and
a firmly set yet handsome mouth were the striking features of a
countenance in which thoughtfulness, determination and nobility of
purpose were reflected as from a mirror. Altogether his appearance was
such that even an inexperienced observer would have pronounced him at
once a more than ordinary man. The feeling of respect with which his
striking exterior inspired me, as well as the other students, became
warmer as I learned to know him better in the course of my private
lessons.... Among the students he had the reputation of being reserved
and taciturn. But I soon found out that, though not mirthful, he was
really very sympathetic and communicative. In these moments he always
spoke of a dear friend, �mile Erckmann, a graduate of Phalsbourg, who
was then following the study of law at Paris as one who shared his
ambition and who had been and would be a partner in his efforts for
literary distinction. He told, with no little pride, that already the
year before they had made their debut with some tales, written
conjointly, in a daily published at Strasburg. One day he handed me a
small volume containing the tales in question, which had attracted so
much attention that a Strasburg publisher had reprinted them in a more
enduring form. The tales interested me the more, in that their subjects
were either incidents in rural life in Alsace and Lorraine or some of
the popular saws, with which the borders of the Rhine abound. I
recollect very well the fascination which the simple narrative, the
charming description of scenery, the lifelike painting of characters,
the quaint humor and the fanciful imagery of these first fruits of my
friend's genius exercised upon my mind. I have reread the tales since
and can truly say that my riper judgment does not differ much from that
first impression."

Here at the college Chatrian met Erckmann, as already noted, and from
here he went to join him.

In Paris, Chatrian took a position with the Eastern Railway paying him
$300 a year. He held it long after the need of it had passed. During the
earlier years of his stay in the metropolis this income, slender though
it was, must have been a necessity to him.

In the late eighties Chatrian's health began to fail. In time he was
afflicted with a stubborn and insidious ailment, which causes its victim
to grow morose and suspicious. Unfortunately his suspicions directed
themselves toward his old friend Erckmann, whom he suspected of cheating
him in the management of their joint interests. Finally an ill-advised
friend published an attack on Erckmann, accusing him of being
unpatriotic. Erckmann sued the paper for libel and recovered heavy
damages. The ultimate responsibility for the attack rested at Chatrian's
door, and he did not long survive this melancholy incident. He died
Sept. 3, 1890.

Much has been written about the wonderfully uniform style of Erckmann
and Chatrian. It is true that one can hardly say of any passage in their
work, "Erckmann wrote this" or "Chatrian wrote that" merely on the basis
of internal evidence.

Many writers have succeeded in securing statements from one or the other
of the literary partners, telling how they collaborated. But if one
reads all these statements side by side, one is convinced that they had
no uniform method of work; that sometimes they worked together in one
way and sometimes in another. It would also appear that each was
slightly jealous of the other, fearing that he would receive more than
his proper share of credit for the work. These facts remain--that
Chatrian was better fitted to market their wares and see them through
the press than was Erckmann; and that Erckmann wrote and published both
before and after his partnership with Chatrian. It may therefore be
fairly accurate to say that without Chatrian Erckmann could have
produced, without being able to sell the works; while Chatrian without
Erckmann could have sold without being able to produce the works.

The stories of Erckmann and Chatrian are noteworthy by reason of the
purity of their subject matter. There is nothing in any of them to
offend the most fastidious, and their popularity in the family circle is
permanent. In the matter of style the authors were not so fortunate.
They began with the idea of purifying the French language, and while
they may have been successful in fixing some of its forms, they have
laid themselves open to criticism by monotonous repetition. But it
cannot be said truthfully that their works exhibit any serious faults of
style.



_Madame Th�r�se_ is one of the _Romans Nationaux_ which lends itself
readily to abridgment. It contains elaborate pictures and extensive
descriptions of Anstatt life that interrupt the thread of the plot
itself. Periodically the story is turned over to the "local color
artist"--whichever of the two he may have been--who has carte blanche to
paint for us beautiful idyllic pictures of life in the little Alsatian
village. But as these pictures are apart from the growth of the cause of
liberty--the main theme of the _Romans Nationaux_--they have frequently
been omitted in this edition.

                             MADAME TH�R�SE




                                   I


       Nous vivions dans une paix profonde au village d'Anstatt,[1] au
       milieu des Vosges allemandes,[2] mon oncle le docteur Jacob
       Wagner, sa vieille servante Lisbeth et moi. Depuis la mort de sa
       soeur Christine,[3] l'oncle Jacob m'avait recueilli chez lui.
       J'approchais de mes dix ans; j'�tais blond, ros� et frais comme
       un ch�rubin. On m'appelait le petit Fritzel au village, et chaque
       soir, en rentrant de ses courses,[4] l'oncle Jacob me faisait
       asseoir[5] sur ses genoux pour m'apprendre � lire en fran�ais
       dans l'_Histoire naturelle_ de M. de Buffon.[6]

       Il me semble encore �tre[7] dans notre chambre basse. Je vois
       l'oncle Jacob, �lanc�, le front haut, surmont� de sa belle
       chevelure blonde dessinant ses larges tempes avec gr�ce,[8] le
       nez l�g�rement aquilin, les yeux bleus, le menton arrondi, les
       l�vres tendres et bonnes.

       C'�tait un homme sentimental,[9] amateur de la paix; il
       approchait de la quarantaine et passait pour �tre le meilleur
       m�decin du pays. J'ai su depuis qu'il se plaisait � faire des
       th�ories sur la fraternit� universelle, et que les paquets de
       livres que lui apportait de temps en temps le messager Fritz
       concernaient cet objet important.

       Tout cela je le vois,[10] sans oublier notre Lisbeth, une bonne
       vieille, qui file dans un coin.

  2    Tous les jours, vers la fin du souper un pas lourd traversait
       l'all�e, la porte s'ouvrait, et sur le seuil apparaissait un
       homme qui disait:

       �Bonsoir, monsieur le docteur.

       --Asseyez-vous, _mauser_,[1] r�pondait l'oncle. Lisbeth, ouvre la
       cuisine.�

       Lisbeth poussait la porte, et la flamme rouge, dansant sur
       l'�tre, nous montrait le taupier en face de notre table,
       regardant de ses petits yeux gris ce que nous mangions.

       Le mauser pouvait avoir cinquante ans; ses cheveux grisonnaient,
       de grosses rides sillonnaient son front rouge�tre.

       On le voyait toujours aux champs en train de poser ses attrapes,
       ou bien � la porte de son rucher � mi-c�te, dans les bruy�res du
       Birkenwald.

       En dehors des taupes et des abeilles, du miel et de la cire, le
       mauser avait encore une autre occupation grave: il pr�disait
       l'avenir moyennant le passage des oiseaux et certaines traditions
       inscrites dans un gros livre � couvercle de bois, qu'il avait
       h�rit� d'une vieille tante de H�ming,[2] et qui l'�clairait sur
       les choses futures.

       Mais pour entamer le chapitre de ses pr�dictions, il lui fallait
       la pr�sence de son ami Koffel, le menuisier, le tourneur,
       l'horloger, le tondeur de chiens, le gu�risseur de b�tes, bref,
       le plus beau g�nie d'Anstatt et des environs.

       Koffel faisait de tout:[3] il rafistolait la vaisselle f�l�e avec
       du fil de fer,[4] il �tamait les casseroles, il r�parait les
       vieux meubles d�traqu�s, il remettait l'orgue en bon �tat quand
       les fl�tes ou les soufflets �taient d�rang�s; l'oncle Jacob avait
  3    m�me d� lui d�fendre de redresser les jambes et les bras cass�s,
       car il se sentait aussi du talent pour la m�decine. Le mauser
       l'admirait beaucoup et disait quelquefois: �Quel dommage que
       Koffel n'ait pas �tudi�!... quel dommage!�

       Mais tout cela ne faisait pas bouillir sa marmite, et le plus
       clair de ses ressources �tait encore d'aller couper de la
       choucroute en automne, son tiroir � rabots[1] sur le dos en forme
       de hotte, criant de porte en porte: �Pas de choux?[2] pas de
       choux?�

       Voil�[3] pourtant comment les grands esprits sont r�compens�s.

       Koffel entrait quelques instants apr�s le mauser, et, s'avan�ant
       � petits pas, il disait d'un air grave:

       �Bon app�tit, monsieur le[4] docteur.

       --Si le coeur vous en dit?[5] r�pondait l'oncle.

       --Bien des remerciements; nous avons mang� ce soir de la salade;
       c'est ce que j'aime le mieux.�

       Apr�s ces paroles, Koffel allait s'asseoir derri�re le fourneau
       et ne bougeait pas jusqu'au moment o� l'oncle disait:

       �Allons, Lisbeth, allume la chandelle et l�ve la nappe.�

       Alors, � son tour, l'oncle bourrait sa pipe et se rapprochait du
       fourneau. On se mettait � causer de la pluie et du beau temps,[6]
       etc.; le taupier avait pos� tant d'attrapes pendant la journ�e,
       ou bien il venait de retirer tant de miel de ses ruches.

       Koffel, lui,[7] ruminait toujours quelque invention; il parlait
       de son horloge sans poids, o� les douze ap�tres devaient para�tre
       au coup de midi, pendant que le coq chanterait et que la mort
       faucherait; ou bien de sa charrue, qui devait marcher toute
       seule, en la remontant comme une pendule, ou de telle autre
       d�couverte merveilleuse.

  4    L'oncle �coutait gravement; il approuvait d'un signe de t�te, en
       r�vant � ses malades.

       Moi, je profitais d'un bon moment pour courir � la forge de
       Klipfel, dont la flamme brillait de loin, dans la nuit, au bout
       du village. Hans Aden, Frantz S�pel et plusieurs autres s'y
       trouvaient d�j� r�unis. Nous regardions les �tincelles partir
       comme des �clairs sous les coups de marteau; nous sifflions[1] au
       bruit de l'enclume. Se pr�sentait-il une vieille[2] rosse �
       ferrer, nous aidions � lui lever la jambe.

       Ainsi se passaient les jours ordinaires de la semaine; mais les
       lundis et les vendredis l'oncle recevait la _Gazette de
       Francfort_, et ces jours-l� les r�unions �taient plus nombreuses
       � la maison. Outre le mauser et Koffel, nous voyions arriver
       notre bourgmestre Christian Meyer et M. Karolus Richter, le
       petit-fils d'un ancien valet du comte de Salm-Salm[3]. Ni l'un ni
       l'autre ne voulait s'abonner � la gazette, mais ils aimaient d'en
       entendre la lecture pour rien.

       Que de fois je me suis rappel� le grand Karolus, le plus grand
       usurier[4] du pays, qui regardait tous les paysans du haut de sa
       grandeur, parce que son grand-p�re avait �t� laquais de
       Salm-Salm, et qui s'imaginait vous faire des gr�ces en fumant
       votre tabac. Combien de fois je l'ai revu en r�ve, allant, venant
       dans notre chambre basse, �coutant, fron�ant le sourcil,
       plongeant tout � coup la main dans la grande poche de l'habit de
       l'oncle, pour lui prendre son paquet de tabac, bourrant sa pipe
       et l'allumant � la chandelle en disant:

       �Permettez!�

       Oui, toutes ces choses, je les revois.

  5    Pauvre oncle Jacob qu'il �tait bonhomme de se laisser fumer son
       tabac, mais il n'y prenait pas m�me garde; il lisait avec tant
       d'attention les nouvelles du jour. Les R�publicains[1]
       envahissaient le Palatinat,[2] ils descendaient le Rhin, ils
       osaient regarder en face les trois �lecteurs,[3] le roi[4]
       Wilhelm de Prusse et l'empereur Joseph.[5]

       Tous les assistants s'�tonnaient de leur audace.

       M. Richter disait que cela ne pouvait[6] durer, et que tous ces
       mauvais gueux seraient extermin�s jusqu'au dernier.

       Sur cette r�flexion, il s'acheminait vers la porte; les autres le
       suivaient.

       �Bonne nuit! criait l'oncle.

       --Bonsoir!� r�pondait le mauser en s'�loignant dans la rue
       sombre.




                                 II


       Or, un vendredi soir du mois de novembre 1793, Lisbeth, apr�s le
       souper, p�trissait la p�te pour cuire le pain du m�nage, selon
       son habitude. Enfin elle me dit:

       �Maintenant, Fritzel, allons nous coucher; demain, quand tu te
       l�veras, il y aura de la tarte.�

       Nous mont�mes donc dans nos chambres. Je me couchai, r�vant de
       bonnes choses, et ne tardai point � m'endormir comme un
       bienheureux.

       Cela durait depuis assez longtemps, mais il faisait encore nuit,
       et la lune brillait en face de ma petite fen�tre, lorsque je fus
       �veill� par un tumulte �trange. On aurait dit que tout le village
       �tait en l'air: les portes s'ouvraient et se refermaient au loin,
  6    une foule de pas traversaient les mares boueuses de la rue. En
       m�me temps j'entendais aller et venir dans notre maison, et des
       reflets pourpres miroitaient sur mes vitres.

       Qu'on se figure mon �pouvante.

       Apr�s avoir �cout�, je me levai doucement et j'ouvris une
       fen�tre. Toute la rue �tait pleine de monde, et non seulement la
       rue, mais encore les petits jardins et les ruelles aux environs:
       rien que[1] de grands gaillards, coiff�s d'immenses chapeaux �
       cornes,[2] et rev�tus de longs habits bleus, la grande queue
       pendant sur le dos, sans parler des sabres et des gibernes.

       Je compris aussit�t que les R�publicains avaient surpris le
       village, et, tout en m'habillant, j'invoquai le secours de
       l'empereur Joseph, dont M. Karolus Richter parlait si souvent.

       Les Fran�ais �taient arriv�s durant notre premier sommeil, et
       depuis deux heures au moins, car lorsque je me penchai pour
       descendre, j'en vis trois, qui retiraient le pain de notre four.
       Ces gens savaient tout faire, rien ne les embarrassait.

       Lisbeth, assise dans un coin, les mains crois�es sur les genoux,
       les regardait d'un air assez paisible; sa premi�re frayeur �tait
       pass�e. Elle me vit au haut de la rampe, et s'�cria:

       �Fritzel, descends... ils ne te feront pas de mal!�

       Alors je descendis. A droite, par la porte de la salle, je voyais
       l'oncle Jacob assis pr�s de la table, tandis qu'un homme
       vigoureux, � gros favoris, �tait install� dans le fauteuil et
       d�chiquetait un de nos jambons avec app�tit. De temps en temps,
       il prenait le verre, levait le coude, buvait un bon coup et
       poursuivait.

  7    Tout en d�chiquetant, l'homme aux gros favoris parlait d'une voix
       brusque:

       �Ainsi, tu es m�decin? disait-il � l'oncle.

       --Oui, monsieur le commandant.

       --Appelle-moi �commandant� tout court, ou �citoyen[1]
       commandant,� je te l'ai d�j� dit; les �monsieur�[2] et les
       �madame�[3] sont pass�s de mode. Mais tu dois conna�tre le pays;
       un m�decin de campagne est toujours sur les quatre chemins.[4] A
       combien sommes-nous de Kaiserslautern?

       --A sept lieues, commandant.

       --Et de Pirmasens?

       --A huit environ.

       --Et de Landau?

       --Je crois � cinq bonnes lieues.

       --Je crois... � peu pr�s... environ... est-ce ainsi qu'un homme
       du pays doit parler? �coute, tu m'as l'air d'avoir peur; tu
       crains que, si les habits blancs[5] passent par ici, on ne te
       pende pour les renseignements que tu m'auras donn�s. �te-toi
       cette id�e de la t�te: la R�publique fran�aise te prot�ge.�

       Le jour gris�tre commen�ait � poindre dehors; on voyait l'ombre
       de la sentinelle se promener l'arme au bras devant nos fen�tres.
       Une sorte de silence s'�tait �tabli. La pendule allait lentement,
       le feu p�tillait toujours dans la cuisine.

       Cela durait depuis quelques instants, lorsqu'un grand bruit
       s'�leva dans la rue; des vitres saut�rent, une porte s'ouvrit
       avec fracas, et notre voisin, Joseph Spick, le cabaretier, se mit
       � crier:

       �Au secours! au feu!�

  8    Mais personne ne bougeait dans le village; chacun �tait bien
       content de se tenir tranquille chez soi. Le commandant �coutait.

       �Sergent Lafl�che!� dit-il.

       Le sergent �tait all� voir, il ne parut qu'au bout d'un instant.

       �Qu'est-ce qui se passe? lui demanda le commandant.

       --C'est un aristocrate de cabaretier qui refuse d'obtemp�rer aux
       r�quisitions de la citoyenne Th�r�se, r�pondit le sergent d'un
       air grave.

       --Eh bien! qu'on me l'am�ne.�

       Le sergent sortit.

       Deux minutes apr�s, notre all�e se remplissait de monde; la porte
       se rouvrit, et Joseph Spick parut sur le seuil, entre quatre
       soldats de la R�publique.

       Derri�re, dans l'ombre, se voyait la t�te d'une femme p�le et
       maigre, qui attira tout de suite mon attention; elle avait le
       front haut, le nez droit, le menton allong� et les cheveux d'un
       noir bleu�tre. Ses yeux �taient grands et noirs.

       Le commandant attendait que tout le monde f�t entr�, regardant
       surtout Joseph Spick, qui semblait plus mort que vif. Puis,
       s'adressant � la femme, qui venait de relever son chapeau d'un
       mouvement de t�te:

       �Eh bien, Th�r�se, fit-il, qu'est-ce qui se passe?

       --Vous savez, commandant, qu'� la derni�re �tape je n'avais plus
       une goutte d'eau-de-vie,[1] dit-elle d'un ton ferme et net; mon
       premier soin, en arrivant, fut de courir par tout le village pour
       en trouver, en la payant, bien entendu. Mais les gens cachent
       tout, et depuis une demi-heure seulement j'ai d�couvert[2] la
       branche[3] de sapin � la porte de cet homme. Le caporal Merlot,
   9   le fusilier Cincinnatus et le tambour-ma�tre Horatius Cocl�s me
       suivaient pour m'aider. Nous entrons, nous demandons du vin, de
       l'eau-de-vie, n'importe quoi; mais le _kaiserlick_[1] n'avait
       rien, il ne comprenait pas, il faisait le sourd.[2] On se met
       donc � chercher, � regarder dans tous les coins, et finalement
       nous trouvons l'entr�e de la cave au fond d'un b�cher, dans la
       cour, derri�re un tas de fagots qu'il avait mis devant.

       �Nous aurions pu nous f�cher; au lieu de cela, nous descendons et
       nous trouvons du vin, du lard, de la choucroute, de l'eau-de-vie;
       nous remplissons nos tonneaux, nous prenons du lard, et puis nous
       remontons sans esclandre. Mais, en nous voyant revenir charg�s,
       cet homme, qui se tenait tranquillement dans la chambre, se mit �
       crier comme un aveugle,[3] et, au lieu d'accepter mes
       assignats,[4] il les d�chira et me prit par le bras en me
       secouant de toutes ses forces. Cincinnatus ayant d�pos� sa charge
       sur la table, prit ce grand flandrin au collet et le jeta contre
       la fen�tre de sa baraque. C'est alors que le sergent Lafl�che est
       arriv�. Voil� tout, commandant.�

       Quand cette femme eut parl� de la sorte, elle se retira derri�re
       les autres.

       Et le commandant s'adressant en allemand � Joseph Spick, lui dit
       en fron�ant les sourcils:

       �Dis donc, toi, est-ce que tu veux �tre fusill�? Cela ne co�tera
       que la peine de te conduire dans ton jardin! Ne sais-tu pas que
       le papier de la R�publique vaut mieux que l'or des tyrans?
       �coute, pour cette fois je veux bien te faire gr�ce, en
       consid�ration de ton ignorance; mais s'il t'arrive encore de
 10    cacher tes vivres et de refuser les assignats en payement, je te
       fais[1] fusiller sur la place du village, pour servir d'exemple
       aux autres. Allons, marche, grand imb�cile!�

       Puis se tournant vers la cantini�re:

       �C'est bien, Th�r�se, dit-il.�

       Tout le monde sortit, Th�r�se en t�te et Joseph le dernier.

       Le commandant se leva, s'avan�a jusqu'� l'une des fen�tres et se
       mit � regarder le village. L'oncle et moi nous regardions �
       l'autre fen�tre. Il pouvait �tre alors cinq heures du matin.




                                 III


       Toute ma vie je me rappellerai cette rue silencieuse encombr�e de
       gens endormis, les uns �tendus, les autres repli�s, la t�te sur
       le sac.

       A droite de notre grange, devant l'auberge de Spick, stationnait
       la charrette de la cantini�re, couverte d'une grande toile.

       La cantini�re, � la fen�tre en face, raccommodait une petite
       culotte, et se penchait de temps en temps pour jeter un coup
       d'oeil sous le hangar, o� dormait un petit tambour d'une douzaine
       d'ann�es, tout blond comme moi, et qui m'int�ressait
       particuli�rement. C'est lui que surveillait la cantini�re, et
       dont elle raccommodait sans doute une culotte. Il avait son petit
       nez rouge en l'air, la bouche entr'ouverte, le dos contre les
       deux tonnes et un bras sur sa caisse; ses baguettes �taient
       pass�es dans la buffleterie, et sur ses pieds, �tait �tendu un
       grand caniche[2] tout crott�, qui le r�chauffait. A chaque
 11    instant cet animal levait la t�te et le regardait comme pour
       dire. �Je voudrais bien faire un tour dans les cuisines du
       village!� Mais le petit ne bougeait pas; il dormait si bien! Et
       comme, dans le lointain, quelques chiens aboyaient, le caniche
       b�illait; il aurait voulu se mettre de la partie.

       Bient�t deux officiers sortirent de la maison voisine; deux
       hommes �lanc�s, jeunes, la taille serr�e dans leur habit. Comme
       ils passaient devant la maison, le commandant leur cria:

       �Duch�ne! Richer!

       --Bonjour, commandant, dirent-ils en se retournant.

       --Les postes sont relev�s?

       --Oui, commandant.

       --Rien de nouveau?

       --Rien, commandant.

       �Allons! s'�cria le commandant d'un ton joyeux, en route!�

       Il prit son manteau, le jeta sur son �paule, et sortit sans nous
       dire ni bonjour, ni bonsoir.

       Nous pensions �tre d�barrass�s de ces gens pour toujours.

       On entendait dehors les officiers commander: �En avant, marche!�
       Les tambours r�sonnaient; et le bataillon se mettait en route,
       quand une sorte de p�tillement terrible retentit au bout du
       village. C'�taient des coups de fusil, qui se suivaient
       quelquefois plusieurs ensemble, quelquefois un � un.

       Les R�publicains allaient entrer dans la rue.

       �Halte!� cria le commandant, qui regardait debout sur ses
       �triers, pr�tant l'oreille.[1]

 12    Je m'�tais mis � la fen�tre, et je voyais tous ces hommes
       attentifs, et les officiers hors des rangs autour de leur chef,
       qui parlait avec vivacit�.

       Tout � coup un soldat parut au d�tour de la rue; il courait, son
       fusil sur l'�paule.

       �Commandant, dit-il de loin, tout essouffl�, les Croates![1]
       L'avant-poste est enlev�... ils arrivent!...�

       A peine le commandant eut-il entendu cela qu'il se retourna,
       courant sur la ligne ventre � terre[2] et criant:

       �Formez le carr�!�

       Les officiers, les tambours, la cantini�re se repliaient[3] en
       m�me temps autour de la fontaine, en moins d'une minute, ils
       form�rent le carr� sur trois rangs,[4] les autres au milieu, et
       presque aussit�t il se fit dans la rue un bruit �pouvantable; les
       Croates arrivaient; la terre en tremblait. Je les vois encore,
       leurs grands manteaux rouges flottant derri�re eux, et courb�s si
       bas sur leur selle, la latte en avant, qu'on apercevait � peine
       leurs faces brunes aux longues moustaches jaunes.

       Il faut que les enfants soient poss�d�s du diable, car, au lieu
       de me sauver, je restai l�, les yeux �carquill�s, pour voir la
       bataille. J'avais bien peur, c'est vrai, mais la curiosit�
       l'emportait encore.[5]

       Le temps de regarder[6] et de fr�mir, les Croates �taient sur la
       place. J'entendis � la m�me seconde le commandant crier: �Feu!�
       Puis un coup de tonnerre, puis rien que le bourdonnement de mes
       oreilles. Tout le c�t� du carr� tourn� vers la rue venait de
       faire feu � la fois; les vitres de nos fen�tres tombaient en
       grelottant; la fum�e entrait dans la chambre avec des d�bris de
       cartouches, et l'odeur de la poudre remplissait l'air.

 13    Moi, les cheveux h�riss�s, je regardais, et je voyais les Croates
       sur leurs grands chevaux, debout dans la fum�e grise, bondir,
       retomber et rebondir, comme pour grimper sur le carr�; et ceux de
       derri�re arriver, arriver sans cesse, hurlant d'une voix sauvage:
       �_Forvertz!_[1] _forvertz!_�

       �Feu du second rang!� cria le commandant, au milieu des
       hennissements et des cris sans fin.

       Il avait l'air de parler dans notre chambre, tant sa voix �tait
       calme.

       Apr�s les feux de peloton[2] commenc�rent les feux de file.[2]
       Les Croates tourbillonnaient autour du carr�, frappant au loin de
       leurs grandes lattes; de temps en temps un chapeau tombait,
       quelquefois l'homme. Un de ces Croates, repliant son cheval sur
       les jarrets, bondit si loin qu'il franchit les trois rangs et
       tomba dans le carr�; mais alors le commandant r�publicain se
       pr�cipita sur lui, et d'un furieux coup de pointe[3] le cloua
       pour ainsi dire[4] sur la croupe de son cheval; je vis le
       R�publicain retirer son sabre rouge jusqu'� la garde; cette vue
       me donna froid; j'allais fuir, mais j'�tais � peine lev� que les
       Croates firent volte-face et partirent, laissant un grand nombre
       d'hommes et de chevaux sur la place.

       Les chevaux essayaient de se relever, puis retombaient. Cinq ou
       six cavaliers, pris sous leur monture, faisaient des efforts pour
       d�gager leurs jambes; quelques-uns, ne pouvant endurer ce qu'ils
       souffraient, demandaient en gr�ce qu'on les achev�t. Le plus
       grand nombre restaient immobiles.

       Pour la premi�re fois je compris bien la mort.

       Dans les rangs des R�publicains il y avait aussi des places
       vides, des corps �tendus sur la face, et quelques bless�s, les
       joues et le front pleins de sang.

 14    Le commandant, � cheval pr�s de la fontaine, faisait serrer les
       rangs.[1] On entendait les trompettes des Croates sonner la
       retraite. Au tournant de la rue, ils avaient fait halte; une de
       leurs sentinelles[2] attendait l�, derri�re l'angle de la maison
       commune;[3] on ne voyait que la t�te de son cheval. Quelques
       coups de fusil partaient encore.

       �Cessez le feu!� cria le commandant.

       Et tout se tut; on n'entendit plus que la trompette au loin.

       La cantini�re fit alors le tour des rangs � l'int�rieur, pour
       verser de l'eau-de-vie aux hommes, tandis que sept ou huit grands
       gaillards allaient puiser de l'eau � la fontaine, dans leurs
       gamelles, pour les bless�s, qui tous demandaient � boire d'une
       voix pitoyable.

       Moi, pench� hors de la fen�tre, je regardais au fond de la rue
       d�serte, me demandant si les manteaux rouges[4] oseraient
       revenir. Le commandant regardait aussi dans cette direction, et
       causait avec un capitaine appuy�[5] sur la selle de son cheval.
       Tout � coup le capitaine traversa le carr�, �carta les rangs et
       se pr�cipita chez nous en criant:

       �Le ma�tre de la maison?

       --Il est sorti.

       --Eh bien... toi... conduis-moi dans votre grenier...vite!�

       Je laissai l� mes sabots,[6] et me mis � grimper l'escalier au
       fond de l'all�e comme un �cureuil.

       Le capitaine me suivait. En haut, il vit du premier coup d'oeil
       l'�chelle du colombier et monta devant moi. Dans le colombier il
       se posa les deux coudes au bord de la lucarne un peu basse, se
 15    penchant pour voir. Je regardais par-dessus son �paule. Toute la
       route, � perte de vue, �tait couverte de monde: de la cavalerie,
       de l'infanterie, des canons, des caissons, des manteaux rouges,
       des pelisses vertes,[1] des habits blancs, et tout cela
       s'avan�ait vers le village.

       �C'est une arm�e!� murmurait le capitaine � voix basse.

       Il se retourna brusquement pour redescendre, mais s'arr�tant sur
       une id�e, il me montra le long du village, � deux port�es de
       fusil, une file de manteaux rouges qui s'enfon�aient dans un
       repli de terrain derri�re les vergers.

       �Tu vois ces manteaux rouges? dit-il.

       --Oui.

       --Est-ce qu'un chemin de voiture passe l�?

       --Non, c'est un sentier.

       --Et ce grand ravin qui le coupe au milieu, droit devant nous,
       est-ce qu'il est profond?

       --Oh! oui.

       --On n'y passe jamais avec les voitures et les charrues?

       --Non, on ne peut pas.�

       Alors, sans m'en demander davantage, il redescendit l'�chelle et
       se jeta dans l'escalier. Je le suivais; nous f�mes bient�t en
       bas, mais nous n'�tions pas encore au bout de l'all�e, que
       l'approche d'une masse de cavalerie faisait fr�mir les maisons.
       Malgr� cela, le capitaine sortit, traversa la place, �carta deux
       hommes dans les rangs et disparut.

       Des milliers de cris brefs, �tranges, semblables � ceux d'une
       nu�e de corbeaux: �Hourrah! hourrah!� remplissaient alors la rue
       d'un bout � l'autre, et couvraient presque le roulement sourd du
       galop.

 16    Moi, tout fier d'avoir conduit le capitaine dans le colombier,
       j'eus l'imprudence de m'avancer sur la porte. Les houlans[1]
       arrivaient comme le vent. Ce fut comme une vision, et ce n'est
       qu'au moment o� la fusillade recommen�a que je me r�veillai comme
       d'un r�ve, au fond de notre chambre, en face des fen�tres
       bris�es.

       L'air �tait obscurci, le carr� tout blanc de fum�e. Le commandant
       se voyait seul derri�re, immobile sur son cheval, pr�s de la
       fontaine; on l'aurait pris pour une statue de bronze, � travers
       ce flot bleu�tre, d'o� jaillissaient des centaines de flammes
       rouges. Les houlans, comme d'immenses sauterelles, bondissaient
       tout autour, dardaient leurs lances et les retiraient; d'autres
       l�chaient leurs grands pistolets dans les rangs, � quatre pas.[2]

       Il me semblait que le carr� pliait; c'�tait vrai.

       �Serrez les rangs! tenez ferme! criait le commandant de sa voix
       calme.

       --Serrez les rangs! serrez!� r�p�taient les officiers de distance
       en distance.

       Mais le carr� pliait, il formait un demi-cercle au milieu; le
       centre touchait presque � la fontaine. A chaque coup de lance,
       arrivait la parade de la ba�onnette comme l'�clair, mais
       quelquefois l'homme s'affaissait. Les R�publicains n'avaient plus
       le temps de recharger; ils ne tiraient plus,[3] et les houlans
       arrivaient toujours, et poussant d�j� des cris de triomphe, car
       ils se croyaient vainqueurs.

       Moi-m�me, je croyais les R�publicains perdus lorsque, au plus
       fort de l'action, le commandant, levant son chapeau au bout de
       son sabre, se mit � chanter une chanson qui vous[4] donnait la
       chair de poule,[5] et tout le bataillon, comme un seul homme, se
 17    mit � chanter avec lui.

       En un clin d'oeil tout le devant du carr� se redressa, refoulant
       dans la rue toute cette masse de cavaliers, press�s les uns
       contre les autres, avec leurs grandes lances, comme les �pis dans
       les champs.

       On aurait dit que cette chanson rendait les R�publicains furieux;
       c'est tout ce que j'ai vu de plus terrible![1]

       Mais ce qu'il y avait encore de plus affreux, c'est que les
       derniers rangs de la colonne autrichienne, tout au bout de la
       rue, ne voyant pas ce qui se passait � l'entr�e de la place,
       avan�aient toujours criant: �Hourrah! hourrah!� de sorte que ceux
       des premiers rangs, pouss�s par les ba�onnettes des R�publicains,
       et ne pouvant plus reculer, s'agitaient dans une confusion
       inexprimable et jetaient des cris de d�tresse; leurs grands
       chevaux, piqu�s aux naseaux, se dressaient la crini�re droite,
       les yeux hors de la t�te, avec des hennissements gr�les et des
       ruades �pouvantables. Je voyais de loin ces malheureux houlans,
       fous de terreur, se retourner, en frappant leurs camarades du
       manche de leurs lances pour se faire place, et d�taler comme des
       li�vres le long des petites cassines.

       Deux minutes apr�s, la rue �tait vide.

       On ne voyait plus que des tas de chevaux et d'hommes morts; le
       sang coulait au-dessous et suivait notre rigole.

       �Cessez le feu! cria le commandant pour la seconde fois;
       chargez!�

       Les R�publicains, diminu�s de moiti�, leurs grands chapeaux
       pench�s sur le dos, l'air dur et terrible, attendaient l'arme au
       bras. Derri�re, � quelques pas de notre maison, le commandant
       d�lib�rait avec ses officiers. Je l'entendais tr�s bien:

 18    �Nous avons une arm�e autrichienne devant nous, disait-il
       brusquement; il s'agit de tirer notre peau[1] d'ici. Dans une
       heure, nous aurons vingt ou trente mille hommes sur les bras;[2]
       ils tourneront le village avec leur infanterie, et nous serons
       tous perdus. Je vais faire battre la retraite.[3] Quelqu'un
       a-t-il quelque chose � dire?

       --Non, c'est bien vu,�[4] r�pondirent les autres.

       Alors ils s'�loign�rent, et deux minutes apr�s je vis un grand
       nombre de soldats entrer dans les maisons, jeter les chaises, les
       tables, les armoires dehors sur un m�me tas; quelques-uns, du
       haut des greniers, jetaient de la paille et du foin; d'autres
       amenaient des charrettes et les voitures du fond des hangars. Il
       ne leur fallut pas dix minutes pour avoir � l'entr�e de la rue[5]
       une barri�re haute comme les maisons; le foin et la paille
       �taient au-dessus et au-dessous. Le roulement du tambour rappela
       ceux qui faisaient cet ouvrage; aussit�t le feu se mit � grimper
       de brindille en brindille jusqu'au haut de la barricade, balayant
       les toits � c�t�, de sa flamme rouge, et r�pandant sa fum�e noire
       comme une vo�te immense sur le village. De grands cris
       s'entendirent alors au loin; des coups de fusil partirent de
       l'autre c�t�; mais on ne voyait rien,[6] et le commandant donna
       l'ordre de la retraite.

       Je vis ces R�publicains d�filer devant chez nous d'un pas lent et
       ferme, les yeux �tincelants, les ba�onnettes rouges, les mains
       noires, les joues creuses. Deux tambours marchaient derri�re sans
       battre; le petit que j'avais vu dormir sous notre hangar s'y
       trouvait; il avait sa caisse sur l'�paule et le dos pli� pour
       marcher; de grosses larmes coulaient sur ses joues rondes,
       noircies par la fum�e de la poudre; son camarade lui disait:
       �Allons, petit Jean, du courage!� Mais il n'avait pas l'air
 19    d'entendre. Horatius Cocl�s avait disparu et la cantini�re aussi.
       Je suivis cette troupe des yeux jusqu'au d�tour de la rue.




                                  IV


       Apr�s le d�part des R�publicains, il se passa bien encore[1] un
       quart d'heure avant que personne ne se montr�t de notre c�t� dans
       la rue. Toutes les maisons semblaient abandonn�es. De l'autre
       c�t� de la barricade, le tumulte augmentait; le cris des gens:
       �Au feu! au feu!� se prolongeaient d'une fa�on lugubre.

       J'�tais sorti sous le hangar, �pouvant� de l'incendie.

       Et comme j'�tais l�, pensant que ces Fran�ais devaient �tre[2] de
       fameux brigands, pour nous br�ler sans aucune raison, un faible
       bruit se fit entendre derri�re moi; je me retournai, et je vis
       dans l'ombre du hangar, sous les brindilles de paille tombant des
       poutres, la porte de la grange entr'ouverte, et derri�re, la
       figure p�le de notre voisin Spick, les yeux �carquill�s. Il
       avan�ait la t�te doucement et pr�tait l'oreille; puis, s'�tant
       convaincu que les R�publicains venaient de battre en retraite,[3]
       il s'�lan�a dehors en brandissant sa hache comme un furieux, et
       criant:

       �O� sont-ils, ces gueux? o� sont-ils, que je les extermine tous!

       --Ah! lui dis-je, ils sont partis; mais, en courant,[4] vous
       pouvez encore les rattraper au bout du village.�

       Alors il me regarda d'un oeil louche, et, voyant que j'�tais sans
       malice,[5] il courut au feu.

       D'autres portes s'ouvraient au m�me instant; des hommes et des
       femmes sortaient, regardaient, puis levaient les mains au ciel,
 20    en criant: �Qu'ils soient maudits![6] qu'ils soient maudits!� Et
       chacun se d�p�chait d'aller prendre son baquet pour �teindre le
       feu.

       L'oncle Jacob rentra chez nous par les jardins.

       �Seigneur Dieu![1] s'�cria-t-il, Fritzel est sauv�!�

       Je vis en cette circonstance qu'il m'aimait beaucoup, car il
       m'embrassa, me demandant:

       �O� donc �tais-tu, pauvre enfant?

       --A la fen�tre,� lui dis-je.

       Alors il devint tout p�le et s'�cria:

       �Lisbeth! Lisbeth!�

       Mais elle ne r�pondit pas, et m�me il nous fut impossible de la
       trouver; nous allions dans toutes les chambres, regardant jusque
       sous les lits, et nous pensions qu'elle s'�tait sauv�e chez
       quelque voisine.

       Dans cet intervalle, on finit par se rendre ma�tre du feu,[2] et
       tout � coup nous entend�mes les Autrichiens crier dehors:
       �Place[3]... place... En arri�re!�

       En m�me temps, un r�giment de Croates passa devant chez nous
       comme la foudre. Ils s'�lan�aient � la poursuite des
       R�publicains; mais nous appr�mes, le lendemain, qu'ils �taient
       arriv�s trop tard: l'ennemi avait gagn� les bois de Rothalps.
       C'est ainsi que nous compr�mes enfin pourquoi ces gens avaient
       barricad� la rue et mis le feu aux maisons: ils voulaient
       retarder la poursuite de la cavalerie, et cela montre bien leur
       grande exp�rience des choses de la guerre.

       Depuis ce moment jusqu'� cinq heures du soir, deux brigades
       autrichiennes d�fil�rent dans le village; puis vers trois heures,
       le g�n�ral en chef, au milieu de ses officiers, un grand
       vieillard v�tu d'une longue polonaise blanche, tellement couverte
 21    de torsades et de broderies d'or, qu'� c�t� de lui le commandant
       r�publicain, avec son chapeau et son uniforme r�p�s, n'aurait eu
       l'air que d'un simple caporal.

       Le bourgmestre et les conseillers d'Anstatt, la t�te d�couverte,
       l'attendaient sur la place. Il s'y arr�ta deux minutes, regarda
       les morts entass�s autour de la fontaine, et demanda:

       �Combien d'hommes les Fran�ais �taient-ils?

       --Un bataillon, Excellence,� r�pondit le bourgmestre courb� en
       demi-cercle.

       Le g�n�ral ne dit rien. Il leva son tricorne[1] et poursuivit sa
       route.

       Alors arriva la seconde brigade, puis les grandes voitures de
       l'ambulance, et derri�re, les �clop�s, les tra�nards et les
       poltrons.

       Les chirurgiens de l'arm�e firent le tour de la place. Ils
       relev�rent les bless�s, les plac�rent dans leurs voitures, et
       l'un de leurs chefs dit au bourgmestre en montrant le reste:

       �Vous ferez enterrer tout cela le plus t�t possible.

       --Pour vous rendre mes devoirs,�[2] r�pondit le bourgmestre
       gravement.

       Et comme le fossoyeur Jeffer avec ses deux gar�ons, Karl et
       Ludwig, arrivaient la pioche sur l'�paule, le bourgmestre leur
       dit:

       �Vous prendrez douze hommes avec vous, et vous ferez une grande
       fosse dans la prairie du Wolfthal pour tout ce monde-l�; vous
       m'entendez? Et tous ceux qui ont des charrettes et des tombereaux
       devront les pr�ter avec leur attelage, car c'est un service
       public.�

 22    Jeffer inclina la t�te et se rendit tout de suite � la prairie du
       Wolfthal, avec ses deux gar�ons et les hommes qu'il avait
       choisis.

       Vers dix heures du soir, une sorte de dispute s'�leva dehors, sur
       la place; nous entend�mes un chien gronder sourdement,[1] et la
       voix de notre voisin Spick dire d'un air irrit�:

       �Attends... attends... gueux de chien, je vais te donner un coup
       de pioche sur la nuque. �a, c'est encore un animal de la m�me
       esp�ce que ses ma�tres; �a[2] vous paye avec des assignats et des
       coups de dents; mais il tombe mal!�[3]

       Le chien grondait plus fort.

       Et d'autres voix disaient au milieu du silence de la nuit:

       �C'est dr�le tout de m�me... Voyez... il ne veut pas quitter
       cette femme... Peut-�tre qu'elle n'est pas tout � fait morte.�

       Alors l'oncle se leva brusquement et sortit. Je le suivis.

       Rien de plus terrible � voir que les morts sous le reflet rouge
       des torches. Il ne faisait pas de vent, mais la flamme se
       balan�ait tout de m�me, et tous ces �tres p�les, avec leurs yeux
       ouverts, semblaient remuer.

       �Pas morte! criait Spick, est-ce que tu es fou, Jeffer? Est-ce
       que tu crois en savoir plus que les chirurgiens de l'arm�e?
       Non... elle a re�u son compte[4]... et c'est bien fait! C'est
       cette femme qui m'a pay� mon eau-de-vie avec du papier.[5]
       Allons, �tez-vous de l� que j'assomme le chien et que �a
       finisse!�

       �Qu'est-ce qui se passe donc?� dit alors l'oncle d'une voix
       forte.

       Et tous ces gens se retourn�rent comme effray�s.

 23    Le fossoyeur se d�couvrit, deux ou trois autres s'�cart�rent, et
       nous v�mes sur les marches de la fontaine la cantini�re �tendue,
       blanche comme la neige, ses beaux cheveux noirs d�roul�s dans une
       mare de sang. Plusieurs autres cadavres l'entouraient, et le
       chien caniche que j'avais vu le matin avec le petit tambour, les
       poils du dos h�riss�s, les yeux �tincelants et les l�vres
       fr�missantes, debout � ses[1] pieds, grondait et frissonnait en
       regardant Spick.

       Malgr� son grand courage et sa pioche, le cabaretier n'osait[2]
       approcher, car il �tait facile de voir que s'il manquait son
       coup, cet animal lui sauterait � la gorge.[3]

       �Qu'est-ce que c'est? r�p�ta l'oncle.

       --Parce que ce chien reste l�, fit Spick en ricanant, ils disent
       que la femme n'est pas morte.

       --Ils ont raison, dit l'oncle d'un ton brusque, certains animaux
       ont plus de coeur et d'esprit que certains hommes. �te-toi de
       l�.�

       Il l'�carta du coude et s'avan�a droit vers la femme en se
       courbant. Le chien, au lieu de sauter sur lui, parut s'apaiser et
       le laissa faire. Tout le monde s'�tait approch�; l'oncle
       s'agenouilla et mit la main sur le coeur de la femme. On se
       taisait; le silence �tait profond. Cela durait depuis pr�s d'une
       minute, lorsque Spick dit:

       �H�! h�! h�! qu'on l'enterre, n'est-ce pas, monsieur le docteur?�

       L'oncle se leva, les sourcils fronc�s, et regardant cet homme en
       face, du haut en bas:[4]

       �Malheureux! lui dit-il, pour quelques mesures d'eau-de-vie que
       cette pauvre femme t'a pay�es comme elle pouvait, tu voudrais
 24    maintenant la voir morte, et peut-�tre enterr�e vive!

       Et, se tournant vers les autres:

       �Jeffer, dit-il, transporte cette femme dans ma maison; elle vit
       encore.�

       Il lan�a sur Spick un dernier regard d'indignation, tandis que le
       fossoyeur et ses fils pla�aient la cantini�re sur le brancard. On
       se mit en marche; le chien suivait l'oncle, serr� contre sa
       jambe.

       Comme nous traversions la place, je vis le mauser et Koffel qui
       nous suivaient, ce qui me soulagea le coeur.

       Nous entrions alors dans la petite all�e. Le mauser, s'arr�tant
       sur le seuil, �claira Jeffer et ses fils, qui s'avan�aient d'un
       pas lourd. Nous les suiv�mes tous dans sa chambre, et le taupier,
       levant sa torche, s'�cria d'un ton solennel:

       �O� sont-ils, les jours de tranquillit�, les instants de paix, de
       repos et de confiance apr�s le travail... o� sont-ils, monsieur
       le docteur?

       --Ah! ils se sont envol�s par toutes ces ouvertures.�

       Alors seulement je vis bien l'air d�sol� de notre vieille
       chambre, les vitres bris�es, dont les �clats tranchants et les
       pointes �tincelantes se d�coupaient sur le fond noir des
       t�n�bres; je compris les paroles du mauser, et je pensai que nous
       �tions malheureux.

       �Jeffer, d�posez cette femme sur mon lit, dit l'oncle avec
       tristesse; il ne faut pas que[1] nos propres mis�res nous fassent
       oublier que d'autres sont encore plus malheureux que nous.�

       Et se tournant vers le taupier:

       �Vous resterez pour m'�clairer, dit-il, et Koffel m'aidera.�

 25    Le fossoyeur et ses fils ayant pos� leur brancard sur le
       plancher, plac�rent la femme sur le lit au fond de l'alc�ve. Le
       mauser les �clairait.

       L'oncle remit quelques kreutzers[1] � Jeffer, qui sortit avec ses
       gar�ons.

       Le chien s'�tait assis devant l'alc�ve, et regardait, � travers
       ses poils fris�s, la femme �tendue sur le lit, immobile et p�le
       comme une morte.

       �Fritzel, me dit l'oncle, ferme les volets, nous aurons moins
       d'air. Et vous, Koffel, faites du feu dans le fourneau.

       Je courus fermer les volets, et j'entendis qu'il les accrochait �
       l'int�rieur. En regardant vers la fontaine, je vis que deux
       nouvelles charrettes de morts partaient. Je rentrai tout
       grelottant.

       Koffel venait d'allumer le feu, qui p�tillait dans le po�le;
       l'oncle avait d�ploy� sa trousse sur la table; le mauser
       attendait, regardant ces mille petits couteaux reluire.

       L'oncle prit une sonde et s'approcha du lit, �cartant les
       rideaux; le mauser et Koffel le suivaient. Alors une grande
       curiosit� me poussa et j'allai voir: la lumi�re de la chandelle
       remplissait toute l'alc�ve. Le chien regardait toujours, il ne
       bougeait pas.

       �Relevez donc le bras, mauser; Koffel, passez ici et soutenez le
       corps.�

       Koffel passa derri�re le lit et prit la femme par les �paules;
       aussit�t la sonde entra bien loin.

       La femme fit entendre un g�missement, et le chien gronda.

       �Allons, s'�cria l'oncle, elle est sauv�e. Tenez, Koffel, voyez,
       la balle a gliss� sur les c�tes, elle est ici sous l'�paule; la
       sentez-vous?

26     --Tr�s bien.�

       L'oncle sortit, appelant Lisbeth.

       �Tu vas chercher une de tes chemises pour cette femme, lui
       dit-il, et tu la lui mettras toi-m�me.--Mauser, Koffel, venez;
       nous allons prendre un verre de vin, car cette journ�e a �t� rude
       pour tous.�




                                  V


       Le lendemain du d�part des R�publicains, tout le village savait
       d�j� qu'une Fran�aise �tait chez l'oncle Jacob, qu'elle avait
       re�u un coup de pistolet et qu'elle en reviendrait[1]
       difficilement. Mais comme il fallait r�parer les toits des
       maisons, les portes et les fen�tres, chacun avait bien assez de
       ses propres affaires sans s'inqui�ter de celles des autres, et ce
       n'est que le troisi�me jour, quand tout fut � peu pr�s remis en
       bon �tat, que l'id�e de la femme revint aux gens.

       Alors aussi Joseph Spick r�pandit le bruit que la Fran�aise
       devenait furieuse, et qu'elle criait: �Vive la R�publique!� d'une
       fa�on terrible.

       Le gueux se tenait sur le seuil de son cabaret, les bras crois�s,
       l'�paule au mur, ayant l'air de fumer sa pipe, et disant aux
       passants:

       �H�! Nickel...Yokel... �coute... �coute, comme elle crie!
       N'est-ce pas abominable? Est-ce qu'on devrait souffrir cela dans
       le pays?�

       L'oncle Jacob, le meilleur homme du monde, en vint �[2] ce point
       d'indignation contre Spick, que je l'entendis r�p�ter plusieurs
       fois qu'il m�ritait d'�tre pendu.

 27    Malheureusement on ne pouvait nier que la femme ne parl�t de la
       France, de la R�publique et d'autres choses contraires au bon
       ordre.

       Un jour l'oncle eut une grande discussion. M. Richter s'�tant
       permis de lui dire qu'il avait tort de s'int�resser � des
       �trangers, venus dans le pays pour piller, il l'�couta
       froidement, et finit par lui r�pondre:

       �Monsieur Richter, quand j'accomplis un devoir d'humanit�, je ne
       demande pas aux gens: �De quel pays �tes-vous? Avez-vous les
       m�mes croyances que moi? �tes-vous riches ou pauvres? Pouvez-vous
       me rendre ce que je vous donne? Je suis[1] les mouvements de mon
       coeur, et le reste m'importe peu. Que cette femme soit Fran�aise
       ou Allemande, qu'elle ait des id�es r�publicaines ou non, qu'elle
       ait suivi des soldats par sa propre volont�, ou qu'elle ait �t�
       r�duite � le faire par besoin, cela ne m'inqui�te pas. J'ai vu
       qu'elle allait mourir, mon devoir �tait de lui sauver la vie; et
       maintenant mon devoir est de continuer, avec la gr�ce de Dieu, ce
       que j'ai bien fait d'entreprendre. Quant � vous, monsieur
       Richter, je sais que vous �tes un �go�ste,[2] vous n'aimez pas
       vos semblables; au lieu de leur rendre service, vous cherchez �
       tirer d'eux des avantages personnels. C'est le fond de[3] votre
       opinion sur toutes choses. Et comme de telles opinions
       m'indignent, je vous prie de ne plus mettre les pieds chez moi.�

       Il ouvrit la porte, et M. Richter ayant voulu r�pliquer, sans
       l'entendre il le prit poliment par le bras et le mit dehors.

       Il ne conserva que le mauser et Koffel pour amis; chacun � son
       tour veillait pr�s de la femme, ce qui ne les emp�chait pas
       d'aller � leurs affaires pendant la journ�e.

       D�s lors la tranquillit� fut r�tablie chez nous.

 28    Or, un matin, en m'�veillant, je vis que l'hiver �tait venu; sa
       blanche lumi�re remplissait ma petite chambre; de gros flocons de
       neige descendaient du ciel par myriades, et tourbillonnaient
       contre mes vitres.

       Je sautai de mon lit et je m'habillai bien vite. Apr�s quoi, sans
       prendre le temps de mettre la seconde manche de ma veste, je
       descendis l'escalier roulant comme une boule.

       L'oncle Jacob venait de rentrer d'une visite; il prenait un petit
       verre de kirschenwasser[1] avec le mauser, qui avait veill� cette
       nuit-l�. Tous deux semblaient de bonne humeur.

       �Ainsi, mauser, disait l'oncle, la nuit s'est bien pass�e?

       --Tr�s bien, monsieur le docteur, nous avons tous dormi: la femme
       dans son lit, moi dans le fauteuil, et le chien sous le rideau.

       --Bon, bon, vous avez bien fait. A votre sant�, mauser!

       --A la v�tre, monsieur le docteur!�

       Ils hum�rent d'un trait leurs petits verres, et les remirent sur
       la table en souriant.

       �Tout va bien, reprit l'oncle, la blessure se ferme, la fi�vre
       diminue, mais les forces manquent encore, le pauvre �tre a perdu
       trop de sang. Enfin, enfin, tout cela reviendra.�

       Le mauser inclina la t�te, et l'oncle me voyant dit en souriant:

       �Eh bien, Fritzel, les pelotes de neige et les glissades vont
       recommencer! Est-ce que cela ne te r�jouit pas?

       --Si,[2] mon oncle.

       --Oui... oui... amuse-toi, on n'est jamais plus heureux qu'� ton
       �ge, gar�on.

 29    Comme nous causions ainsi, quelques paroles s'entendirent dans
       l'alc�ve; tout le monde se tut, pr�tant l'oreille.

       �Ceci, mauser, murmura l'oncle, n'est plus la voix du d�lire,
       c'est une voix faible, mais naturelle.�

       Et se levant, il �carta les rideaux. Le mauser et moi nous �tions
       derri�re lui. La femme semblait dormir; on l'entendait � peine
       respirer. Mais au bout d'un instant, elle ouvrit les yeux et nous
       regarda l'un apr�s l'autre, comme �tonn�e, puis le fond de
       l'alc�ve, puis les fen�tres blanches de neige, l'armoire, la
       vieille horloge, puis le chien qui s'�tait dress�, la patte au
       bord du lit. Cela dura bien une minute; enfin elle referma les
       yeux, et l'oncle dit tout bas:

       �Elle est revenue � elle.[1]

       --Oui, fit le mauser du m�me ton, elle nous a vus, elle ne nous
       conna�t pas, et maintenant elle songe � ce qu'elle vient de
       voir.�

       Nous allions nous retirer, quand la femme rouvrit les yeux, et,
       faisant un effort, voulut parler. Mais alors l'oncle, �levant la
       voix, lui dit avec bont�:

       �Ne vous agitez pas, madame, soyez calme, n'ayez aucune
       inqui�tude... Vous �tes chez des gens qui ne vous laisseront
       manquer de rien... Vous avez �t� malade... maintenant vous allez
       mieux... Mais, je vous en prie, ayez confiance... vous �tes chez
       des amis... chez de v�ritables amis.�

       Pendant qu'il parlait, la femme le regardait de ses grands yeux
       noirs; on voyait qu'elle le comprenait. Mais malgr� sa
       recommandation, apr�s un instant de silence, elle essaya de
       parler encore et dit tout bas:

       Le tambour... le petit tambour...�

 30    Alors l'oncle, regardant le mauser, lui demanda:

       �Comprenez-vous?�

       Et le mauser, portant la main � sa t�te, dit:

       �Un restant de fi�vre, docteur, un petit restant; cela passera.�

       Mais la femme, d'un accent plus fort, r�p�ta...

       �Jean... le petit tambour!�

       Je me tenais sur la pointe des pieds, fort attentif; et l'id�e me
       vint tout � coup qu'elle parlait du petit tambour que j'avais vu
       couch� sous notre hangar, le jour de la grande bataille.

       Je me rappelai qu'elle le regardait aussi de la fen�tre en face,
       en raccommodant sa petite culotte, et je dis:

       �Oncle, elle parle peut-�tre du petit tambour qui �tait avec les
       R�publicains.�

       Aussit�t la pauvre femme voulut se retourner[1].

       �Oui... oui... fit-elle, Jean... mon fr�re!

       --Restez, madame, dit l'oncle, ne faites pas de mouvement; votre
       blessure pourrait se rouvrir. Mauser, approchez la chaise.�

       Et me prenant sous les bras, il m'�leva devant elle en me disant:

       �Raconte � madame ce que tu sais, Fritzel. Tu te rappelles le
       petit tambour?

       --Oh! oui; le matin de la bataille, il �tait couch� sous notre
       hangar, le chien sur ses pieds; il dormait, je me le rappelle
       bien! lui r�pondis-je tout troubl�, car la femme me regardait
       alors jusqu'au fond de l'�me, comme elle avait regard� l'oncle.

       --Et ensuite, Fritzel?

 31    --Ensuite, il �tait avec les autres tambours, au milieu du
       bataillon quand les Croates sont arriv�s. Et tout � la fin,[1]
       quand on a mis le feu dans la rue, et que[2] les R�publicains
       sont partis, je l'ai revu derri�re.

       --Bless�? fit la femme d'une voix si faible, qu'on pouvait �
       peine l'entendre.

       --Oh! non; il avait son tambour sur l'�paule et pleurait en
       marchant, et un autre plus grand lui disait: �Allons, courage,
       petit Jean, courage!� Mais il n'avait pas l'air d'entendre... il
       avait les joues toutes mouill�es.

       --Tu es bien s�r de l'avoir vu s'en aller, Fritzel? demanda
       l'oncle.

       --Oui, mon oncle: il me faisait de la peine;[3] je l'ai regard�
       jusqu'au bout du village.�

       Alors la femme referma les yeux, et nous entend�mes qu'elle
       sanglotait int�rieurement.[4] Des larmes lui coulaient le long
       des joues, l'une apr�s l'autre, sans bruit. C'�tait bien triste,
       et l'oncle me dit tout bas:

       �Descends, Fritzel, il faut la laisser pleurer sans g�ne.�

       Mais comme j'allais descendre, elle �tendit la main, et me retint
       en murmurant quelques paroles. L'oncle Jacob la comprit et lui
       demanda:

       �Vous voulez embrasser l'enfant?

       -- Oui,� fit-elle.

       Il me pencha sur sa figure; elle m'embrassa en sanglotant
       toujours. Moi, je m'�tais mis aussi � pleurer.

       �C'est bon, fit l'oncle, c'est bon. Il vous faut maintenant du
       calme, madame; il faut t�cher de dormir, la sant� vous
       reviendra... Vous reverrez votre jeune fr�re... Du courage!�

       Il m'emmena dehors et referma les rideaux.

 32    Le mauser se promenait de long en large[1] dans la salle; il
       avait la figure rouge et dit:

       ��a, monsieur le docteur, c'est une brave femme, une honn�te
       femme... qu'elle soit r�publicaine ou tout ce qu'on voudra[2]...
       celui qui penserait le contraire ne serait qu'un gueux.

       --Oui, r�pondit l'oncle, c'est une nature g�n�reuse, je l'ai
       reconnu tout de suite � sa figure. Il est heureux que Fritzel se
       soit rappel� l'enfant. La pauvre femme avait une grande
       inqui�tude. Je comprends maintenant pourquoi ce nom de Jean
       revenait toujours dans son d�lire. Tout ira mieux, mauser, tout
       ira mieux, les larmes soulagent.�

       Ils sortirent ensemble dans l'all�e; je les entendis encore
       causer de ces choses sur le seuil de la maison.

       Et comme je m'�tais assis derri�re le fourneau, et que[3] je
       m'essuyais les joues du revers de la manche, tout � coup je vis
       le chien pr�s de moi, qui me regardait[4] avec douceur. Il me
       posa la patte sur le genou et se mit � me caresser; pour la
       premi�re fois je pris sa grosse t�te fris�e entre mes bras, sans
       crainte. Il me semblait que nous �tions amis depuis longtemps et
       que je n'avais jamais eu peur de lui.

       En levant les yeux au bout d'une minute, j'aper�us l'oncle qui
       venait d'entrer et qui m'observait en souriant.

       �Tu vois, Fritzel, comme le pauvre animal t'aime, dit-il;
       maintenant il te suivra, car il a reconnu ton bon coeur.�

       Et c'�tait vrai, depuis ce jour le caniche ne refusa plus de
       m'accompagner; au contraire, il me suivait gravement dans tout le
       village.

 33




                                  VI


       La neige ne cessa point de tomber ce jour-l� ni la nuit suivante;
       chacun pensait que les chemins de la montagne en seraient
       encombr�s et qu'on ne reverrait plus ni les uhlans ni les
       R�publicains; mais un petit �v�nement vint encore montrer aux
       gens les tristes suites de la guerre, et les faire r�fl�chir sur
       les malheurs de ce bas[1] monde.

       C'�tait le lendemain du jour ou la femme avait repris
       connaissance, que le bourgmestre Meyer entra.

       �Salut, monsieur le docteur, salut! dit le gros homme. J'arrive
       par un temps de neige; mais que voulez-vous, il le faut,[2] il le
       faut!

       --Un pauvre diable[3] monsieur le docteur, est �tendu dans le
       b�cher de R�ebock, derri�re un tas de fagots. C'est un soldat. Il
       se sera[4] retir� l� pour mourir sans trouble pendant le combat.
       A cette heure,[5] il faudrait[6] dresser l'acte mortuaire; je ne
       peux pas v�rifier de quoi cet homme est mort.

       --C'est bien, bourgmestre, dit l'oncle en se levant,
       j'arrive.�[7]

       Ils sortirent et je les suivais.

       Enfin nous arriv�mes � la grange de R�ebock et j'aper�us �
       droite, �tendu contre le mur, un grand manteau rouge, puis, une
       t�te noire avec de longues moustaches.

       Je vois, fit l'oncle, je vois!�

       Et il s'approcha en disant:

       �C'est un Croate.�

       L'oncle tira l'homme par une jambe et le fit glisser en pleine
       lumi�re.

       Puis il ouvrit la boucle du manteau.

 34    �Il est mort d'un coup de ba�onnette, sans doute pendant la
       derni�re rencontre.�

       Tout le monde devenait r�veur; le silence, aupr�s de ce mort,
       vous donnait froid.

       �Enfin voil� le d�c�s constat�,[1] fit l'oncle au bout d'un
       instant, nous pouvons partir.�

       Puis se ravisant.

       �Peut-�tre y aurait-il moyen de savoir quel est cet homme!�

       Il s'agenouilla de nouveau, mit la main dans une poche de la
       veste et trouva des papiers.

       �Je garde ces papiers pour dresser l'acte, dit-il au bourgmestre.
       Maintenant nous pouvons partir.�

       L'oncle m'apercevant alors, dit:

       �Te voil� Fritzel? Il faut donc que tu voies tout?�

       Il ne me fit pas d'autres reproches, et nous rentr�mes ensemble �
       la maison.

       Tout en marchant, l'oncle parcourait les papiers du Croate. En
       ouvrant la porte de notre chambre, nous v�mes que la femme venait
       de prendre un bouillon, les rideaux �taient encore ouverts et
       l'assiette sur la table de nuit.

       �Eh bien, madame, dit l'oncle Jacob en souriant, vous allez
       mieux?�

       Alors, elle, qui s'�tait retourn�e et qui le regardait avec
       douceur de ses grands yeux noirs, r�pondit:

       �Oui, monsieur le docteur, vous m'avez sauv�e, je me sens
       revivre.�

       Puis, au bout d'une seconde, elle ajouta d'un ton plein de
       compassion:

       �Vous venez encore de reconna�tre une malheureuse victime de la
       guerre!�

 35    L'oncle comprit qu'elle avait tout entendu, lorsque le
       bourgmestre �tait venu le prendre une demi-heure avant.

       �C'est vrai, dit-il, c'est vrai, madame; encore un malheureux qui
       ne reverra plus le toit de sa maison, encore une pauvre m�re qui
       n'embrassera plus son fils.�

       La femme semblait �mue et demanda tout bas:

       �C'est un des n�tres?

       --Non, madame, c'est un Croate. Je viens de lire en marchant une
       lettre que sa m�re lui �crivait il y a trois semaines. La pauvre
       femme lui recommande de ne pas oublier ses pri�res du matin et du
       soir et de bien se conduire. Elle lui parle avec tendresse, comme
       � un enfant. C'�tait pourtant un vieux soldat, mais elle le
       voyait sans doute encore tout ros� et tout blond, comme le jour
       o�, pour la derni�re fois, elle l'avait embrass� en sanglotant.�

       La voix de l'oncle en parlant de ces choses s'attendrissait; il
       regardait la femme qui, de son c�t�, semblait aussi touch�e.

       �Oui, vous avez raison, dit-elle, ce doit �tre affreux
       d'apprendre qu'on ne verra plus son enfant. Moi, du moins, j'ai
       la consolation de ne pouvoir plus causer d'aussi grandes douleurs
       � ceux qui m'aimaient.�

       Alors elle d�tourna la t�te, et l'oncle, devenu tr�s grave, lui
       demanda:

       �Vous n'�tes pourtant pas seule au monde?

       --Je n'ai plus ni p�re ni m�re, fit-elle d'une voix basse; mon
       p�re �tait chef du bataillon que vous avez vu; j'avais trois
       fr�res, nous �tions tous partis ensemble en 92, de F�n�trange en
       Lorraine. Maintenant trois sont morts, le p�re et les deux a�n�s;
       il ne reste plus que moi et Jean, le petit tambour.�

 36    La femme, en disant cela, semblait pr�te � fondre en larmes.
       L'oncle, le front pench�, les mains crois�es sur le dos, se
       promenait de long en large dans la chambre. Le silence revenait.

       Tout � coup la Fran�aise reprit:

       �J'aurais quelque chose � vous demander[1] monsieur le docteur?

       --Quoi, madame?

       --Ce serait d'�crire � la m�re du malheureux Croate. C'est
       terrible, sans doute, d'apprendre la mort de son fils, mais de
       l'attendre toujours, d'esp�rer pendant des ann�es qu'il
       reviendra, et de voir qu'il n'arrive pas, m�me � la derni�re
       heure, ce doit �tre plus cruel encore.�

       Elle se tut, et l'oncle tout r�veur r�pondit:

       �Oui... oui, c'est une bonne pens�e! Fritzel, apporte l'encre et
       le papier. Quelle mis�re, mon Dieu! dire qu'on annonce des choses
       pareilles, et que ce sont encore de bonnes actions! Ah! la
       guerre... la guerre.�

       Il s'assit et se mit � �crire.

       Enfin l'oncle finit sa lettre; il la plia, la cacheta, �crivit
       l'adresse et me dit:

       �Va, Fritzel, jette cette lettre � la bo�te, et d�p�che-toi.




                                 VII


       En revenant de la poste, j'avais aper�u tout au loin, dans la
       grande prairie communale,[2] derri�re l'�glise, Hans Aden, Frantz
       S�pel et bien d'autres de mes camarades qui glissaient sur le
       gu�voir.

       Comme mon coeur galopait en les voyant! comme j'aurais voulu
 37    pouvoir les rejoindre! Malheureusement l'oncle Jacob m'attendait
       alors, et je rentrai la t�te pleine de ce joyeux spectacle.

       Pendant tout le d�ner, l'id�e de courir l�-bas ne me quitta pas
       une seconde; mais je me gardai bien d'en parler � l'oncle, car il
       me d�fendait toujours[1] de glisser sur le gu�voir, � cause des
       accidents. Enfin il sortit pour aller faire une visite � M. le
       cur�, qui souffrait de ses rhumatismes.

       J'attendis qu'il f�t entr� dans la grande rue,[2] puis je sifflai
       Scipio, et je me mis � courir jusqu'� la ruelle des Houx, comme
       un li�vre.

       Je croyais retrouver tous mes camarades sur le gu�voir, mais ils
       �taient all�s d�ner; je ne vis, au tournant de l'�glise,[3] que
       les grandes glissades d�sertes. Il me fallut donc glisser seul,
       et, comme il faisait froid, au bout d'une demi-heure j'en eus
       bien assez.

       Je reprenais le chemin du village, quand Hans Aden, Frantz S�pel
       et deux ou trois autres d�bouch�rent d'entre les haies couvertes
       de givre.

       �Tiens! c'est toi, Fritzel! me dit Hans Aden; tu t'en vas?

       --Oui, je viens de glisser, et l'oncle Jacob ne veut pas que je
       glisse; j'aime mieux m'en aller.

       --Moi, dit Frantz S�pel, j'ai fendu mon sabot sur la glace ce
       matin, et mon p�re l'a raccommod�. Voyez un peu.�[4]

       Il d�fit son sabot et nous le montra. Le p�re Frantz S�pel avait
       mis une bande de t�le en travers avec quatre gros clous � t�te
       pointue. Cela nous fit rire, et Frantz S�pel s'�cria:

 38    ��a, ce n'est pas commode pour glisser! �coutez, allons plut�t
       en tra�neau; nous monterons sur l'Altenberg, et nous descendrons
       comme le vent.

       --Oui, dit Hans Aden; mais comment avoir un tra�neau?

       --Laissez-moi faire,� r�pondit Frantz S�pel, le plus malin de
       nous tous.

       Et toute la troupe se remettait en route. De temps en temps on
       regardait Scipio, qui marchait pr�s de moi.

       �Vous avez un beau chien, faisait Hans Aden, c'est un chien
       fran�ais; ils ont de la laine comme les moutons et se laissent
       tondre sans rien dire.�

       Frantz S�pel soutenait qu'il avait vu l'ann�e pr�c�dente, � la
       foire de Kaiserslautern, un chien fran�ais avec des lunettes et
       qui comptait sur un tambour jusqu'� cent. Il devinait aussi
       toutes sortes de choses, et la grand'm�re Anne pensait que ce
       devait �tre un sorcier.

       Nous allions donc ainsi, de maison en maison, et deux heures
       sonnaient � l'�glise, lorsque M. Richter passa sur son tra�neau,
       en criant � sa grande bique d�charn�e:

       �Allez, Charlotte, allez!�

       La pauvre b�te allongeait ses hanches,[1] et M. Richter contre
       son ordinaire, paraissait tout joyeux. En passant devant la
       maison du boucher S�pel, il cria:

       �Bonne nouvelle, S�pel, bonne nouvelle!�

       Il faisait claquer son fouet, et Hans Aden dit:

       �M. Richter est un peu gris; il aura[2] trouv� quelque part du
       vin qui ne lui co�tait rien.�

       Alors toute la bande rit de bon coeur, car tout le village savait
       que Richter �tait un avare.

       Nous �tions arriv�s au bout de la grand'rue,[3] devant la maison
 39    du p�re[4] Adam Schmitt, un vieux soldat de Fr�d�ric II,[1] qui
       recevait une petite pension pour acheter son pain et son tabac,
       et de temps en temps du _schnaps_.[2]

       Adam Schmitt avait fait la guerre de Sept ans[3] et toutes les
       campagnes de Sil�sie et de Pom�ranie. Maintenant il �tait tout
       vieux, et il vivait seul dans la derni�re maison du village, une
       petite maison n'ayant qu'une seule pi�ce en bas, une au-dessus et
       le toit avec ses deux lucarnes.

       L'oncle Jacob aimait ce vieux soldat; quelquefois, en le voyant
       passer, il frappait � la vitre et lui criait: �Adam, entrez
       donc!�

       Aussit�t l'autre entrait, sachant que l'oncle avait du v�ritable
       cognac de France dans une armoire, et qu'il l'appelait pour lui
       en offrir un petit verre.

       Nous f�mes donc halte devant sa maison, et Frantz S�pel nous dit:

       �Regardez-moi[4] ce tra�neau. Je parie que le p�re Schmitt nous
       le pr�tera, pourvu que Fritzel entre hardiment, et qu'il dise:
       �P�re Adam, pr�tez-nous votre _schlitte_!� Oui je parie qu'il
       nous le pr�tera, j'en suis s�r; seulement il faut du courage.�

       J'�tais devenu tout rouge. Tous les camarades, au coin de la
       maison, me poussaient par l'�paule en disant:

       �Entre, il te le pr�tera!

       --Je n'ose pas, leur disais-je tout bas.

       --Tu n'as pas de courage, r�pondait Hans Aden; � ta place, moi,
       j'entrerais tout de suite.

       --Laissez-moi seulement regarder un peu s'il est de bonne
       humeur.�

       Alors je me penchai vers la petite fen�tre, et, regardant du coin
       de l'oeil, je vis le p�re Schmitt assis devant la pierre de
 40    l'�tre, o� brillaient quelques braises au milieu d'un tas de
       cendres. Il fumait sa pipe de terre, qui d�passait un peu de
       c�t�[1] sa joue creuse.

       Tous les autres me pouss�rent dans l'all�e en disant tout bas:

       �Fritzel... Fritzel... il te le pr�tera, bien s�r!

       --Non!

       --Si![2]

       --Je ne veux pas.�

       Mais Hans Aden avait ouvert la porte, et j'�tais d�j� dans la
       chambre avec Scipio, les autres, derri�re moi, pench�s, les yeux
       �carquill�s, regardant et pr�tant l'oreille.

       Oh! comme j'aurais voulu m'�chapper! Malheureusement Frantz
       S�pel, du dehors, retenait la porte � demi ferm�e; il n'y avait
       de place que pour sa t�te et celle de Hans Aden, debout sur la
       pointe des pieds derri�re lui.

       Le vieux Schmitt s'�tait retourn�:

       �Tiens! c'est Fritzel![3] dit-il en se levant. Qu'est-ce qui se
       passe donc?�

       Il ouvrit la porte, et toute la bande s'enfuit. Je restai seul.
       Le vieux soldat me regardait tout �tonn�.

       �Qu'est-ce que vous voulez donc, Fritzel?� fit-il en prenant une
       braise sur l'�tre pour rallumer sa pipe.

       Puis, voyant Scipio, il le contempla gravement en tirant de
       grosses bouff�es de tabac.[4]

       Moi, j'avais repris un peu d'assurance.

       �P�re Schmitt, lui dis-je, les autres veulent que je vous demande
       votre tra�neau pour descendre de l'Altenberg.�

       Le vieux soldat, en face du caniche, clignait de l'oeil et
       souriait. Au lieu de r�pondre, il se gratta l'oreille[6] en
       relevant son bonnet, et me demanda:

       �C'est � vous, ce chien, Fritzel?

 41    --Oui, p�re Adam, c'est le chien de la femme que nous avons chez
       nous.�

       --Ah! bon, �a doit �tre un chien de soldat; il doit conna�tre
       l'exercice.�[1]

       Scipio nous regardait le nez en l'air, et le p�re Schmitt,
       retirant la pipe de ses l�vres, dit:

       �C'est un chien de r�giment; il ressemble au vieux Michel, que
       nous avions en Sil�sie.�

       Alors �levant la pipe, il s'�cria: �Portez armes!� d'une voix si
       forte, que toute la baraque en retentit.

       Mais quelle ne fut pas ma surprise, de voir Scipio s'asseoir, les
       pattes de devant pendantes, et se tenir comme un v�ritable
       soldat!

       �Ha! ha! ha!� s'�cria le vieux Schmitt, je le savais bien!�

       Tous les camarades �taient revenus; les uns regardaient par la
       porte entr'ouverte, les autres par la fen�tre. Scipio ne bougeait
       pas, et le p�re Schmitt, aussi joyeux qu'il avait paru grave
       auparavant, lui dit:

       �Attention au commandement de marche!� Puis, imitant le bruit du
       tambour, et marchant en arri�re sur ses gros sabots, il se mit �
       crier:

       _�Arche!_ Pan... pan... rantanplan... Une... _deusse_... Une...
       _deusse!_�

       Et Scipio marchait avec une mine grave �tonnante, ses longues
       oreilles sur les �paules et la queue en trompette.[2]

       C'�tait merveilleux; mon coeur sautait.

       Tous les autres, dehors, paraissaient confondus d'admiration.

       �Halte!� s'�cria Schmitt, et Scipio s'arr�ta.

       Alors je ne pensais plus � la _schlitte_; j'�tais tellement fier
 42    des talents de Scipio, que j'aurais voulu courir � la maison, et
       crier � l'oncle: �Nous avons un chien qui fait l'exercice!�

       Mais Hans Aden, Frantz S�pel et tous les autres, encourag�s par
       la bonne humeur du vieux soldat, �taient entr�s.

       �En place, repos!�[1] dit le p�re Schmitt, et Scipio retomba sur
       ses quatre pattes, en secouant la t�te et se grattant la nuque
       avec une patte de derri�re, comme pour dire: �Depuis deux minutes
       une puce me d�mange; mais on n'ose pas se gratter sous les
       armes!�

       Le p�re Schmitt regardait Scipio d'un air attendri; on voyait
       qu'il lui rappelait le bon temps de son r�giment.

       �Oui, fit-il au bout de quelques instants, c'est un vrai chien de
       soldat. Mais reste[2] � savoir s'il conna�t la politique, car
       beaucoup de chiens ne savent pas la politique.�

       En m�me temps, il prit un b�ton derri�re[3] la porte et le mit en
       travers,[4] en criant:

       �Attention au mot d'ordre!�

       Scipio se tenait d�j� pr�t.

       �Saute pour la R�publique!� cria le vieux soldat.

       Et Scipio sauta par-dessus le b�ton, comme un cerf.

       �Saute pour le g�n�ral Hoche!�[5]

       Scipio sauta.

       �Saute pour le roi de Prusse!�

       Mais alors Scipio s'assit sur sa queue d'un air tr�s ferme, et le
       vieux bonhomme[6] se mit � sourire tout bas,[7] les yeux pliss�s,
       en disant:

       �Oui, il conna�t la politique... h�! h�! h�! Allons...
       arrive!�[8]

       Il lui passa la main sur la t�te, et Scipio parut tr�s content.

 43    �Fritzel, me dit alors le p�re Schmitt, vous avez un chien qui
       vaut son pesant d'or; c'est un vrai chien de soldat.�

       Et nous regardant tous, il ajouta:

       �Puisque vous avez un si bon chien, je vais vous pr�ter ma
       _schlitte_; mais vous me la ram�nerez � cinq heures, et prenez
       garde de vous casser le cou.�[1]

       Il sortit avec nous et d�crocha son tra�neau du hangar.

       Mon esprit se partageait alors entre le d�sir d'aller annoncer �
       l'oncle les talents extraordinaires de Scipio, ou de descendre
       l'Altenberg sur notre _schlitte_. Mais quand je vis Hans Aden,
       Frantz S�pel, tous les camarades, les uns devant, les autres
       derri�re, pousser et tirer en galopant comme des bienheureux,[2]
       je ne pus r�sister au plaisir de me joindre � la bande.

       Schmitt nous regardait de sa porte.

       �Prenez garde de rouler!� nous dit-il encore.

       Puis il rentra, pendant que nous filions dans la neige. Scipio
       sautait � c�t� de nous. Je vous laisse � penser notre joie, nos
       cris et nos �clats de rire jusqu'au sommet de la c�te.

       Nous continu�mes � monter et � descendre jusque vers quatre
       heures. Alors la nuit commen�ait � se faire, et chacun se rappela
       notre promesse au p�re Schmitt. Nous repr�mes donc le chemin du
       village. En approchant de la demeure du vieux soldat, nous le
       v�mes debout sur sa porte.[3] Il nous avait entendus rire et
       causer de loin.

       �Vous voil�! s'�cria-t-il; personne ne s'est fait de mal?

       --Non, p�re Schmitt.

       --A la bonne heure.�[4]

       Il remit sa _schlitte_ sous le hangar, et moi, sans dire ni
 44    bonjour ni bonsoir, je partis en courant, heureux d'annoncer �
       l'oncle quel chien nous avions l'honneur de poss�der. Cette id�e
       me rendait si content, que j'arrivai chez nous sans m'en
       apercevoir; Scipio �tait sur mes talons.

       �Oncle Jacob, m'�criai-je en ouvrant la porte, Scipio conna�t
       l'exercice! le p�re Schmitt a vu tout de suite que c'�tait un
       v�ritable chien de soldat; il l'a fait marcher sur les pattes de
       derri�re comme un grenadier, rien qu'en disant: �Une...
       _deusse_!�

       L'oncle lisait derri�re le fourneau; en me voyant si
       enthousiaste, il d�posa son livre au bord de la chemin�e et me
       dit d'un air �merveill�:

       �Est-ce bien possible, Fritzel? Comment!... comment!...

       --Oui! m'�criai-je, et il sait aussi la politique: il saute pour
       la R�publique, pour le g�n�ral Hoche, mais il ne veut pas sauter
       pour le roi de Prusse.�

       L'oncle alors se mit � rire, et, regardant la femme, qui souriait
       aussi dans l'alc�ve, le coude sur l'oreiller:

       �Madame Th�r�se, dit-il d'un ton grave, vous ne m'aviez pas
       encore parl� des beaux talents de votre chien. Est-il bien vrai
       que Scipio sache tant de belles choses?

       --C'est vrai, monsieur le docteur, dit-elle en caressant le
       caniche qui s'�tait approch� du lit et qui lui tendait la t�te
       d'un air joyeux; oui, il sait tout cela, c'�tait l'amusement du
       bataillon; Petit-Jean lui montrait tous les jours quelque chose
       de nouveau. N'est-ce pas, mon pauvre Scipio? Combien de fois
       notre p�re et les deux a�n�s ne se sont-ils pas r�jouis de te
       voir monter la garde? Tu faisais rire tout notre monde par ton
       air grave et tes talents; on oubliait les fatigues de la route
       autour de toi, on riait de bon coeur!�

 45    Elle disait ces choses, tout attendrie, d'une voix douce, en
       souriant un peu tout de m�me. Scipio avait fini par[1] se
       dresser, les pattes au bord du lit, pour entendre son �loge.




                                 VIII


       Ce m�me soir, apr�s le souper, l'oncle Jacob fumait sa pipe en
       silence derri�re le fourneau. Moi, je s�chais le bas de mon
       pantalon, la t�te de Scipio entre les genoux.

       Cela durait depuis environ une demi-heure lorsque je fus r�veill�
       par un bruit de sabots dans l'all�e; en m�me temps, la porte
       s'ouvrit, et la voix joyeuse du mauser dit dans la chambre:

       �De la neige, monsieur le docteur, de la neige! Elle recommence �
       tomber, nous en avons encore pour toute la nuit.�

       Il para�t que l'oncle avait fini par s'assoupir, car,
       seulement[2] au bout d'un instant, je l'entendis se remuer et
       r�pondre:

       �Que voulez-vous,[3] mauser, c'est la saison; il faut s'attendre
       � cela maintenant.�

       Puis il se leva et alla dans la cuisine chercher de la lumi�re.

       Le mauser s'approchait dans l'ombre.

       �Tiens! Fritzel est l�! dit-il. Tu n'as donc pas encore sommeil?

       L'oncle rentrait.

       Je tournai la t�te, et je vis que le mauser souriait, en plissant
       ses petits yeux, et qu'il tenait quelque chose sous le bras.

 46    �Vous venez pour la gazette, mauser? dit l'oncle. Elle n'est pas
       arriv�e ce matin, le messager est en retard.

       --Non, monsieur le docteur, non; je viens pour autre chose.�

       Il d�posa sur la table un vieux livre.

       �Voil� pourquoi j'arrive! dit le mauser; je n'ai pas besoin de
       nouvelles, moi; quand je veux savoir ce qui se passe dans le
       monde, j'ouvre et je regarde.�

       La porte s'ouvrit de nouveau. C'�tait notre ami Koffel qui venait
       nous voir.

       �Bonsoir, monsieur le docteur, fit-il en secouant son bonnet dans
       le vestibule; j'arrive tard; beaucoup de gens m'ont arr�t� sur la
       route, au _Boeuf-Rouge_[1] et au _Cruchon-d'Or_.[1]

       --Entrez, Koffel, lui dit l'oncle. Vous avez bien ferm� la porte
       de l'all�e?

       --Oui, docteur Jacob, ne craignez rien.�

       Il entra, et souriant:

       �La gazette n'est pas arriv�e ce matin? dit-il.

       --Non, mais nous n'en avons pas besoin, r�pondit l'oncle d'un
       accent de bonne humeur un peu comique. Nous avons le livre du
       mauser, qui raconte le pr�sent, le pass� et l'avenir.

       --Est-ce qu'il raconte aussi notre victoire?� demanda Koffel en
       se rapprochant du fourneau.

       L'oncle et le mauser se regard�rent �tonn�s.

       �Quelle victoire? fit le mauser.

       --H�! celle d'avant-hier, � Kaiserslautern. On ne parle que de
       cela dans tout le village; c'est Richter, M. Richter qui est
 47    revenu de l�-bas, vers deux heures, apporter la nouvelle. Au
       _Cruchon-d'Or_, on a d�j� vid� plus de cinquante bouteilles en
       l'honneur des Prussiens: les R�publicains sont en pleine
       d�route!�

       A peine eut-il parl� des R�publicains, que nous regard�mes du
       c�t� de l'alc�ve, songeant que la Fran�aise �tait l� et qu'elle
       nous entendait. Cela nous fit de la peine, car c'�tait une brave
       femme, et nous pensions que cette nouvelle pouvait lui causer
       beaucoup de mal. L'oncle leva la main, en hochant la t�te d'un
       air d�sol�; puis il se leva doucement et entr'ouvrit les rideaux
       pour voir si madame Th�r�se dormait.

       �C'est vous, monsieur le docteur, dit-elle aussit�t; j'ai tout
       entendu.

       --Ah! madame Th�r�se, dit l'oncle, ce sont de fausses nouvelles.

       --Je ne crois pas, monsieur le docteur. Du moment[1] qu'une
       bataille s'est livr�e[2] avant-hier � Kaiserslautern, il faut que
       nous ayons eu le dessous, sans quoi les Fran�ais auraient march�
       tout de suite sur Landau, pour d�bloquer la place et couper la
       retraite aux Autrichiens: leur aile droite aurait travers� le
       village.�

       Puis �levant la voix:

       �Monsieur Koffel, dit-elle, voulez-vous me dire les d�tails que
       vous savez?�

       Le mauser avait pris la chandelle sur la table, et nous �tions
       tous entr�s dans l'alc�ve. Moi au pied du lit, Scipio contre la
       jambe, je regardais en silence.

       Madame Th�r�se regardait Koffel, qui ne quittait pas des yeux
       l'oncle Jacob, comme pour lui demander ce qu'il fallait faire.

 48    �Ce sont des bruits qui courent au village, dit-il d'un air
       embarrass�; ce Richter ne m�rite pas pour deux liards[1] de
       confiance.

       --C'est �gal, monsieur Koffel, racontez-moi cela, dit-elle; M. le
       docteur le permet. N'est-ce pas, monsieur le docteur, vous le
       permettez?

       --Sans doute, fit l'oncle d'un air de regret. Mais il ne faut pas
       croire tout ce qu'on rapporte.

       --Non... on exag�re, je le sais bien; mais il vaut mieux savoir
       les choses que de se figurer mille id�es; cela tourmente moins.�

       Koffel se mit donc � raconter que deux jours avant les Fran�ais
       avaient attaqu� Kaiserslautern, et que, depuis sept heures du
       matin jusqu'� la nuit ils avaient livr� de terribles combats pour
       entrer dans les retranchements; que les Prussiens les avaient
       �cras�s par milliers; que les Fran�ais avaient tout abandonn�;
       qu'on les massacrait partout, et que la cavalerie de
       Brunswick,[2] envoy�e � leur poursuite, faisait des prisonniers
       en masse.

       Madame Th�r�se ne disait rien. Elle �coutait, et de temps en
       temps, lorsque Koffel voulait s'arr�ter-- car de raconter ces
       choses devant cette pauvre femme, cela lui faisait beaucoup de
       peine--elle lui lan�ait un regard tr�s calme, et il poursuivait,
       disant: �On raconte encore ceci ou cela, mais je ne le crois
       pas.�

       Enfin il se tut, et madame Th�r�se, durant quelques instants,
       continua � r�fl�chir. Puis, comme l'oncle disait: �Tout cela, ce
       ne sont que des bruits... On ne sait rien de positif.... Vous
       auriez tort de vous d�soler, madame Th�r�se;� elle se releva
       l�g�rement, et nous dit d'une voix tr�s simple:

 49    ��coutez, il est clair que nous avons �t� repouss�s. Mais ne
       croyez pas, monsieur le docteur, que cela me d�sole; non, cette
       affaire, qui vous para�t consid�rable, est peu de chose pour moi.
       J'ai vu ce m�me Brunswick arriver jusqu'en Champagne,[1] � la
       t�te de cent mille hommes de vieilles troupes, lancer des
       proclamations[2] qui n'avaient pas le sens commun, menacer toute
       la France et ensuite reculer, devant des paysans en sabots, la
       ba�onnette dans les reins,[3] jusqu'en Prusse. Mon p�re,--un
       pauvre ma�tre d'�cole, devenu chef de bataillon;--mes fr�res,--de
       pauvres ouvriers, devenus capitaines par leur courage,--et moi
       derri�re avec le petit Jean, dans ma charrette, nous lui avons
       fait la conduite,[4] apr�s les d�fil�s de l'Argonne[5] et la
       bataille de Valmy[6]. Ne croyez donc pas que de telles choses
       m'effrayent. Nous ne sommes pas cent mille hommes, ni deux cent
       mille: nous sommes six millions de paysans, qui voulons manger
       nous-m�mes[7] le pain que nous avons gagn� p�niblement par notre
       travail. C'est juste, et Dieu est avec nous.

       �Ce n'est pas une d�faite, ni vingt, ni cent qui peuvent nous
       abattre, reprit-elle; quand un de nous tombe, dix autres se
       l�vent. Ce n'est pas pour le roi de Prusse, ni pour l'empereur
       d'Allemagne que nous marchons, c'est pour l'abolition des
       privil�ges de toute sorte, pour la libert�, pour la justice, pour
       les droits de l'homme!--Pour nous vaincre, il faudra nous
       exterminer jusqu'au dernier, fit-elle avec un sourire �trange, et
       ce n'est pas aussi facile qu'on le croit. Seulement il est bien
       malheureux que tant de milliers de braves gens de votre c�t� se
       fassent massacrer pour des rois et des nobles qui sont leurs plus
 50    grands ennemis, quand le simple bon sens devrait leur dire de se
       mettre avec nous, pour chasser tous ces oppresseurs du pauvre
       peuple; oui, c'est bien malheureux, et voil� ce qui me fait plus
       de peine que tout le reste.�

       Ayant parl� de la sorte, elle se recoucha, et l'oncle Jacob,
       �tonn� de la justesse de ses paroles, resta quelques instants
       silencieux.

       Le mauser et Koffel se regardaient sans rien dire, mais on voyait
       bien que les r�flexions de la Fran�aise les avaient frapp�s et
       qu'ils pensaient: �Cette femme a raison.�

       Au bout d'une minute seulement, l'oncle dit:

       �Du calme, madame Th�r�se, du calme, tout ira mieux; sur bien des
       choses nous pensons de m�me, et si cela ne d�pendait que de moi,
       nous ferions bient�t la paix ensemble.

       --Oui, monsieur le docteur, r�pondit-elle, je le sais, car vous
       �tes un homme juste, et nous ne voulons que la justice.

       --T�chez d'oublier tout cela, dit encore l'oncle Jacob; il ne
       vous faut plus maintenant que du repos pour �tre en bonne sant�.

       --Je t�cherai, monsieur le docteur.�

       Alors nous sort�mes de l'alc�ve, et l'oncle, nous regardant tout
       r�veur, dit:

       �Voil� bient�t dix heures, allons nous coucher, il est temps.�

       Il reconduisit Koffel et le mauser dehors, et poussa le verrou
       comme � l'ordinaire. Moi, je grimpais d�j� l'escalier.

51




                                 IX


       Le lendemain, lorsque je m'�veillai, la neige encombrait mes
       petites fen�tres; il en tombait encore. Dehors tintaient les
       clochettes du tra�neau de l'oncle Jacob. Je pensai qu'il fallait
       quelque chose d'extraordinaire pour d�cider l'oncle � se mettre
       en route par un temps[1] pareil, et, m'�tant habill�, je
       descendis bien vite savoir ce que cela pouvait �tre.

       L'all�e �tait ouverte; l'oncle, enfonc� dans la neige jusqu'aux
       genoux, arrangeait � la h�te une botte de paille dans le
       tra�neau.

       �Tu pars, oncle? lui criai-je en m'avan�ant sur le seuil.

       --Oui, Fritzel, oui, je pars, dit-il d'un ton joyeux; est-ce que
       tu veux m'accompagner?�

       Mais voyant ces gros flocons tourbillonner et songeant qu'il
       ferait froid, je r�pondis:

       �Un autre jour, oncle; aujourd'hui, j'aime mieux rester.�

       Alors il rit tout haut, et, rentrant, il me pin�a l'oreille, ce
       qu'il faisait toujours lorsqu'il �tait de bonne humeur.

       �Maintenant, tout est pr�t, dit l'oncle en ouvrant le
       garde-manger et fourrant dans sa poche une cro�te de pain. Eh
       bien, madame Th�r�se, me voil� sur mon d�part. Quel bon temps
       pour aller en tra�neau!�

       Madame Th�r�se regardait les fen�tres d'un air tout m�lancolique.

       �Vous allez voir un malade, monsieur le docteur? dit-elle.

       --Oui, un pauvre b�cheron de Dannbach, � trois lieues d'ici, qui
       s'est laiss� prendre sous sa _schlitte_;[2] c'est une blessure
       grave et qui ne souffre aucun retard.

 52    --Quel rude m�tier vous faites! dit madame Th�r�se d'une voix
       attendrie; sortir par un temps pareil pour secourir un
       malheureux, qui ne pourra peut-�tre jamais reconna�tre vos
       services!

       --Eh! sans doute, r�pondit l'oncle en bourrant sa grande pipe de
       porcelaine, cela m'est arriv� d�j� bien souvent; mais que
       voulez-vous? parce qu'un homme est pauvre, ce n'est pas une
       raison pour le laisser mourir; nous sommes tous fr�res, madame
       Th�r�se, et les malheureux ont le droit de vivre comme les
       riches.

       --Oui, vous avez raison, et pourtant combien d'autres, � votre
       place, resteraient tranquillement pr�s de leur feu, au lieu de
       risquer leur vie, pour le seul plaisir de faire le bien!�

       Et levant les yeux avec expression:

       �Monsieur le docteur, dit-elle, vous �tes un r�publicain.

       --Moi, madame Th�r�se! que me dites-vous l�? s'�cria l'oncle en
       riant.

       --Oui, un vrai r�publicain, reprit-elle: un homme que rien
       n'arr�te, qui m�prise toutes les souffrances, toutes les mis�res
       pour accomplir son devoir.

       --Ah! si vous l'entendez ainsi, je serais heureux de m�riter ce
       nom, r�pondit l'oncle. Mais, dans tous les partis et dans tous
       les pays du monde, il se trouve des hommes pareils.

       --Alors, monsieur Jacob, ils sont r�publicains sans le savoir.�

       L'oncle ne put s'emp�cher de sourire:

       �Vous avez r�ponse � tout, dit-il en fourrant son paquet de tabac
       dans la grande poche de sa houppelande, on ne peut pas discuter
       avec vous!�

 53    Quelques instants de silence suivirent ces paroles. Le cheval
       continuait � hennir dehors, et madame Th�r�se s'�tait mise �
       regarder les gros flocons qui tourbillonnaient contre les vitres,
       lorsque l'oncle, ayant allum� sa pipe, dit:

       �Je vais rester absent jusqu'au soir. Allons, madame Th�r�se, au
       revoir et bon courage!

       --Au revoir! monsieur le docteur, fit-elle en lui tendant sa
       longue main d'un air d'attendrissement; allez, et que le ciel
       vous conduise.�

       Ils rest�rent ainsi quelques instants tout r�veurs; puis l'oncle
       dit:

       �Ce soir, entre six et sept heures, je serai de retour, madame
       Th�r�se; ayez bonne confiance, soyez sans inqui�tude, tout ira
       mieux.�

       Apr�s quoi nous sort�mes; il enjamba l'�chelle[1] du tra�neau, et
       toucha son cheval Rappel du bout de son fouet, en me disant:

       �Conduis-toi bien, Fritzel.�

       Quand l'oncle eut disparu au coin de la rue, Lisbeth me demanda:

       �Dis donc, Fritzel, est-ce que tu restes ici?

       --Non, je vais voir le petit Hans Aden.

       --Eh bien, �coute: puisque tu mets tes sabots, va donc chez le
       mauser me chercher du miel pour la Fran�aise; monsieur le docteur
       veut qu'on lui fasse une boisson avec du miel. Prends ton �cuelle
       et va l�-bas. Tu diras au mauser que c'est pour l'oncle Jacob.
       Voici l'argent.�

       Rien ne me plaisait tant que d'avoir � faire des commissions,
 54    surtout chez le mauser, qui me traitait comme un homme
       raisonnable. Je pris donc l'�cuelle et je sortis avec Scipio pour
       me rendre chez le taupier.

       A l'auberge du _Cruchon-d'Or_, on entendait tinter les verres et
       les bouteilles; on chantait, on riait, les gens montaient et
       descendaient l'escalier. Un vendredi,[1] cela me parut
       extraordinaire; je m'arr�tai pour voir si c'�tait une noce ou un
       bapt�me, et comme je me tenais de l'autre c�t� de la rue, sur la
       pointe des pieds, regardant dans la petite all�e ouverte, je vis,
       au fond de la cuisine, la silhouette �trange du mauser se pencher
       devant la flamme, son bout de pipe noire au coin des l�vres, et
       sa main brune qui posait une braise sur le tabac.

       Un instant apr�s, le mauser revint lentement dans l'all�e sombre,
       lan�ant de grosses bouff�es. Alors je lui criai:

       �Mauser! mauser!�

       Il s'avan�a jusqu'au bord de l'escalier, et me dit en riant:

       �C'est toi, Fritzel?

       --Oui, je vais chez vous chercher du miel.

       --H�! monte donc boire un coup; nous irons ensemble tout �
       l'heure.�

       Et se tournant vers la cuisine:

       �Gr�del, cria-t-il, apportez un verre pour Fritzel.�

       Je m'�tais d�p�ch� de monter, et nous entr�mes, Scipio sur nos
       talons.

       Dans la salle on ne voyait, le long des tables, que des gens en
       blouse, en veste, en camisole, levant leurs verres pleins d'un
       air joyeux, et c�l�brant la grande victoire de Kaiserslautern.

       Je suivais le mauser, qui s'avan�ait, le dos rond, vers les
 55    fen�tres de la rue. L� se trouvaient, dans le coin � droite,
       l'ami Koffel et le vieux Adam Schmitt, devant une bouteille de
       vin blanc. Dans l'autre coin, en face, l'aubergiste Joseph Spick
       et M. Richter buvaient du _gleiszeller_[1] au cachet vert. Ils
       �taient pourpres tous les deux jusqu'aux oreilles, et criaient:

       �A la sant� de Brunswick! � la sant� de notre glorieuse arm�e!

       --H�! fit le mauser en s'approchant de notre table, place pour un
       homme.�

       Et Koffel, se retournant, me serra la main, tandis que le p�re
       Schmitt disait:

       �A la bonne heure, � la bonne heure, voici du renfort.�

       Il me fit asseoir pr�s de lui, contre le mur, et Scipio vint
       aussit�t lui lever la main du bout de son nez,[2] d'un air de
       vieille connaissance.

       �H�! h�! h�! disait le vieux soldat, c'est toi, l'ancien;[3] tu
       me reconnais!�

       Gr�del apporta un verre; le mauser l'emplit.

       Au m�me instant, M. Richter se mit � crier � l'autre bout de la
       table, d'un ton moqueur:

       �H�! Fritzel, comment va M. le docteur Jacob? Il ne vient donc
       pas c�l�brer la grande bataille! C'est �tonnant, �tonnant, un si
       bon patriote!�

       Et moi, ne sachant que r�pondre, je dis tout bas � Koffel:

       �L'oncle est parti sur son tra�neau pour soigner un pauvre
       b�cheron qui s'est laiss� prendre sous sa _schlitte_.�

       Alors Koffel, se retournant, s'�cria d'une voix claire:

       �Pendant que le petit-fils d'un ancien domestique de Salm-Salm
       s'allonge les jambes sous la table pr�s du po�le, et qu'il boit
 56    du _gleiszeller_ en l'honneur des Prussiens, qui se moquent de
       lui, M. le docteur Jacob traverse les neiges pour aller voir un
       pauvre b�cheron de la montagne �cras� sous sa _schlitte_. �a
       rapporte moins que de pr�ter � gros int�r�ts,[1] mais �a prouve
       plus de coeur tout de m�me.�

       Koffel avait un petit coup de trop, et tous les gens l'�coutaient
       en souriant. Richter ne r�pondit pas d'abord, mais au bout d'un
       instant il dit:

       �Eh! que ne fait-on pas par amour des Droits de l'homme, de la
       d�esse Raison[2] et du Maximum, surtout quand une vraie citoyenne
       vous encourage!

       --Monsieur Richter, taisez-vous! s'�cria le mauser d'une voix
       forte. M. le docteur est aussi bon Allemand que vous, et cette
       femme, dont vous parlez sans la conna�tre, est une brave femme.
       Le docteur Jacob n'a fait que son devoir en lui sauvant la vie;
       vous devriez rougir d'exciter les gens du village contre un
       pauvre �tre malade qui ne peut se d�fendre! c'est abominable!

       --Je me tairai si cela me convient, s'�cria Richter � son tour.
       Vous criez bien haut... Ne dirait-on pas que les Fran�ais ont
       remport� la victoire!�

       Alors le mauser frappa du poing sur la table, � faire tomber les
       verres; il parut vouloir se lever, mais il se rassit et dit:

       �J'ai droit de me r�jouir des victoires de la vieille Allemagne
       autant que vous, monsieur Richter, car moi je suis un vieil
       Allemand comme mon p�re, comme mon grand-p�re, et tous les
       mausers connus depuis deux cents ans au village d'Anstatt pour
       l'�levage des abeilles et la mani�re de prendre les taupes; au
       lieu que les cuisiniers des Salm-Salm, de p�re en fils, se
 57    promenaient en France avec leurs ma�tres pour tourner la broche
       et l�cher le fond des marmites.�

       Toute la salle partit d'un �clat de rire � ce propos, et M.
       Richter, voyant que la plupart n'�taient pas pour lui, jugea
       prudent de se mod�rer; il r�pondit donc d'un ton calme:

       �Je n'ai jamais rien dit contre vous ni contre le docteur Jacob;
       au contraire, je sais que M. le docteur est un homme habile et un
       honn�te homme. Mais cela n'emp�che pas qu'en un jour comme
       celui-ci tout bon Allemand doit se r�jouir. Car, �coutez bien,
       ceci n'est pas une victoire ordinaire, c'est la fin de cette
       fameuse R�publique une et indivisible.

       --Comment! comment! s'�cria le vieux Schmitt, la fin de la
       R�publique? Voil� du nouveau!

       --Oui, elle ne durera plus six mois, fit Richter avec assurance;
       car, de Kaiserslautern, les Fran�ais seront balay�s jusqu'�
       Hornbach, de Hornbach � Sarrebruck, � Metz, et ainsi de suite
       jusqu'� Paris. Une fois en France, nous trouverons des amis en
       foule pour nous secourir: la noblesse, le clerg� et les honn�tes
       gens sont tous pour nous; ils n'attendent que notre arm�e pour se
       lever. Et quant � ce tas de gueux ramass�s � droite et � gauche,
       sans officiers et sans discipline, qu'est-ce qu'ils peuvent faire
       contre des Brunswick, des Wurmser[1] et des centaines d'autres
       vieux capitaines �prouv�s par tous les p�rils de la guerre de
       Sept ans?�

       Toute la salle �tait alors de l'avis de Richter, et plusieurs
       disaient:

       �A la bonne heure,[2] voil� ce qui s'appelle parler; depuis
       longtemps nous pensions les m�mes choses.�

 58    Le mauser et Koffel se taisaient; mais le vieux Adam Schmitt
       hochait la t�te en souriant. Apr�s un instant de silence, il
       d�posa sa pipe sur la table et dit:

       �Monsieur Richter, vous parlez comme l'almanach; vous pr�disez
       l'avenir d'une fa�on admirable; mais tout cela n'est pas aussi
       clair pour les autres que pour vous. Je veux bien croire que la
       vieille race est n�e pour faire les g�n�raux, puisque les nobles
       arrivent tous au monde capitaines; mais, de temps en temps, il
       peut aussi sortir des g�n�raux de la race des paysans, et ceux-l�
       ne sont pas les plus mauvais, car ils le sont devenus par leur
       propre valeur. Ces R�publicains, qui vous paraissent si b�tes,
       ont quelquefois de bonnes id�es tout de m�me; par exemple,
       d'�tablir chez eux que le premier venu pourra devenir
       feld-mar�chal, pourvu qu'il en ait le courage et la capacit�; de
       cette fa�on, tous les soldats se battent comme de v�ritables
       enrag�s; ils tiennent dans leurs rangs comme des clous et
       marchent en avant comme des boulets, parce qu'ils ont la chance
       de monter en grade s'ils se distinguent, de devenir capitaine,
       colonel ou g�n�ral. Les Allemands se battent maintenant pour
       avoir des ma�tres, et les Fran�ais se battent pour s'en
       d�barrasser, ce qui fait encore une grande diff�rence. Je les ai
       regard�s de la fen�tre du p�re Diemer en face de la fontaine,
       pendant les deux charges des Croates et des uhlans, des charges
       magnifiques; eh bien, cela m'a beaucoup �tonn�, monsieur Richter,
       de voir comme ces jacobins ont support� �a! Et leur commandant
       m'a fait un v�ritable plaisir. Il n'�tait pas aussi bien habill�
       qu'un major prussien, mais il se tenait aussi tranquille sur son
       cheval que si on lui avait jou� un air. Finalement, ils se sont
 59    tous retir�s, c'est vrai, mais ils avaient une division sur le
       dos, et n'ont laiss� que les fusils et les gibernes des morts sur
       la place. Avec des soldats pareils, croyez-moi, monsieur Richter,
       il y a de la ressource.[1] Les vieilles races guerri�res sont
       bonnes, mais les jeunes poussent au-dessous, comme les petits
       ch�nes sous les grands, et quand les vieux pourrissent, ceux-l�
       les remplacent. Je ne crois donc pas que les R�publicains se
       sauvent comme vous le dites; ce sont d�j� de fameux soldats, et
       s'il leur vient un g�n�ral ou deux, gare! Et prenez bien garde[2]
       que ce n'est pas impossible du tout, car, entre douze ou quinze
       cent mille paysans, il y a plus de choix qu'entre dix ou douze
       mille nobles; la race n'est peut-�tre pas aussi fine, mais elle
       est plus solide.�

       Le vieux Schmitt reprit alors haleine un instant, et comme tout
       le monde l'�coutait, il ajouta:

       �Tenez, moi, par exemple, si j'avais eu le bonheur de na�tre dans
       un pays pareil, est-ce que vous croyez que je me serais content�
       d'�tre Adam Schmitt, sergent de grenadiers, avec cent florins de
       pension, six blessures et quinze campagnes? Non, non, �tez-vous
       cette id�e de la t�te; je serais le commandant, le colonel ou le
       g�n�ral Schmitt, avec une bonne retraite de deux mille thalers,
       ou bien mes os dormiraient depuis longtemps quelque part. Quand
       le courage m�ne � tout, on a du courage, et quand il ne sert qu'�
       devenir sergent et � faire avancer les nobles en grade, chacun
       garde sa peau.

       --Et l'instruction! s'�cria Richter, vous comptez donc
       l'instruction pour rien, vous? Est-ce qu'un homme qui ne sait pas
       lire vaut un duc de Brunswick qui sait tout?�

       Alors Koffel, se retournant, dit d'un air calme:

 60    �C'est juste, monsieur Richter, l'instruction fait la moiti� de
       l'homme, et peut-�tre les trois quarts. Voil� pourquoi ces
       R�publicains se battent jusqu'� la mort; ils veulent que leurs
       fils re�oivent de l'instruction aussi bien que les nobles. Le
       plus grand crime de ceux qui gouvernent dans ce bas monde, c'est
       de refuser l'instruction aux mis�rables, afin que leurs races
       nobles soient toujours au-dessus; c'est comme s'ils crevaient les
       yeux des hommes, lorsqu'ils viennent au monde, pour profiter de
       leur travail.[1]

       Ainsi parla Koffel, disant que si ses parents avaient pu le faire
       instruire, au lieu d'�tre un pauvre diable, il aurait peut-�tre
       fait honneur � Anstatt et serait devenu quelque chose d'utile.
       Chacun pensait comme lui, et plusieurs se disaient entre eux:
       �Que serions-nous si l'on nous avait instruits? Est-ce que nous
       �tions plus b�tes que les autres?�

       M. Richter, voyant tout le monde contre lui, et ne sachant que
       r�pondre aux paroles judicieuses de Koffel, haussa les �paules
       comme pour dire: �Ce sont des fous gonfl�s d'orgueil, des �tres
       qu'il faudrait mettre � la raison.�

       Or le silence commen�ait � se r�tablir et le mauser venait de
       faire apporter une seconde bouteille, lorsque des grondements
       sourds s'entendirent sous la table; aussit�t nous regard�mes et
       nous v�mes le grand chien roux de M. Richter qui tournait autour
       de Scipio. Ce chien s'appelait Max. Il �tait grand, sec et
       nerveux. Il voulait passer derri�re Scipio, qui se retournait
       toujours la t�te haute et la l�vre fr�missante.

 61    En regardant du c�t� de M. Richter, je vis qu'il excitait son
       chien en dessous; le p�re Schmitt s'en aper�ut aussi, car il
       s'�cria:

       �Monsieur Richter, vous avez tort d'exciter votre chien. Ce
       caniche, voyez-vous, est un chien de soldat, rempli de finesse et
       qui conna�t toutes les ruses de la guerre. Le v�tre est peut-�tre
       d'une vieille race; mais, prenez garde, celui-ci serait bien
       capable de l'�trangler.

       --�trangler mon chien! s'�cria Richter; il en avalerait dix comme
       ce mis�rable roquet; d'un coup de dent il lui casserait
       l'�chine!�

       En entendant cela, je voulus me sauver avec Scipio, car M.
       Richter excitait toujours son grand Max, et tous les buveurs se
       retournaient en riant pour voir la bataille. J'avais envie de
       pleurer; mais le vieux Schmitt me retenait par l'�paule en me
       disant tout bas:

       �Laissez faire, laissez faire... ne craignez rien, Fritzel; je
       vous dis que notre chien conna�t la politique... l'autre n'est
       qu'une grosse b�te qui n'a rien vu.�

       Et se tournant vers Scipio, il lui r�p�tait toujours: �Attention!
       attention!�

       Scipio ne bougeait pas; il se tenait le derri�re[1] dans le coin
       de la fen�tre, la t�te droite, ses yeux luisants sous ses grands
       poils fris�s, et, dans le coin de sa moustache tremblotante, on
       voyait une dent blanche tr�s pointue.

       Le grand roux s'avan�ait. Ils grondaient tous deux, jusqu'au
       moment o� Max fit un bond pour saisir Scipio � la gorge; aussit�t
       trois ou quatre �clats de voix brefs, terribles, partirent � la
       fois. Scipio s'�tait baiss� pendant que l'autre l'attrapait � la
       tignasse, et d'un coup de dent sec[2] il lui faisait claquer la
       patte.[3]

 62    C'est alors qu'il fallut entendre[1] les cris plaintifs de Max,
       et qu'il fallut le voir se glisser en boitant sous les tables; il
       filait comme un �clair entre les jambes, en r�p�tant ses cris
       aigus qui vous per�aient les oreilles.

       M. Richter s'�tait lev� furieux pour tomber sur Scipio; mais, au
       m�me instant, le mauser avait pris son b�ton au coin de[2] la
       porte, et disait:

       �Monsieur Richter, si votre grosse b�te est mordue, � qui la
       faute? Vous l'avez assez excit�e; maintenant elle est peut-�tre
       estropi�e, �a vous apprendra!�

       Et le vieux Schmitt, riant jusqu'aux larmes, faisait mettre
       Scipio entre ses genoux et criait:

       �Je savais bien qu'il connaissait les finesses de la guerre; h�!
       h�! h�! nous avons remport� les drapeaux et les canons.�

       Tous les assistants riaient avec lui; de sorte que M. Richter,
       indign�, chassa lui-m�me son chien dans la rue � grands coups de
       pied, pour ne plus entendre ses cris. Il aurait bien voulu en
       faire autant � Scipio, mais tout le monde �tait dans l'�tonnement
       de son courage et de son bon sens naturel.

       �Allons, s'�cria le mauser en se levant, arrive maintenant,
       Fritzel, arrive! Il est temps que je te donne ce que tu veux. Je
       vous salue, monsieur Richter; vous avez un fameux chien. Gr�del,
       vous marquerez[3] deux bouteilles sur l'ardoise.�

       Je retournai chez nous, bien content de ce qui venait d'arriver.

63




                                  X


       Au coin de l'�glise, je rencontrai le petit Hans Aden, qui me
       cria:

       �Fritzel! Fritzel!�

       Puis il demanda:

       �Qu'est-ce que tu fais, cette apr�s-midi?

       --Je ne sais pas; j'irai me promener avec Scipio.

       --�coute, si tu veux, dit-il, nous irons poser des attrapes
       derri�re les arbres du _Postth�l_.[1]

       --Je veux bien,� lui r�pondis-je.

       Apr�s quoi, chacun reprit son chemin, et je rentrai chez nous
       vers midi.

       Quelques instants apr�s la vieille servante apporta la petite
       soupi�re pour Madame Th�r�se et moi et nous d�n�mes.

       A chaque instant je tournais la t�te pour regarder si Hans Aden
       ne se promenait pas d�j� sur le perron de l'�glise.

       Enfin il traversa la place; il regardait vers notre maison,
       �piant du coin de l'oeil; j'�tais d�j� dans l'all�e et j'ouvrais
       la porte. En peu de temps nous posions nos attrapes entre les
       arbres.

       Lorsque j'arrivai chez nous, il faisait nuit. Lisbeth pr�parait
       le souper.

       La nuit dehors devenait noire.

       De temps en temps madame Th�r�se interrompait la vieille
       servante, levant le doigt et disant:

       ��coutez!�

       Alors tout le monde restait tranquille une seconde.

 64    �Ce n'est rien, faisait Lisbeth: c'est la charrette de Hans
       Bockel qui passe� ou bien: �c'est la m�re Dreyfus qui s'en va
       maintenant � la veill�e chez les Br�mer.�

       Elle connaissait les habitudes de tous les gens d'Anstatt, et se
       faisait un v�ritable bonheur d'en parler � la dame fran�aise,
       maintenant qu'elle avait vu la sainte Vierge pendue � son cou;
       car sa nouvelle amiti� venait de l�, comme je l'appris plus tard.

       Sept heures sonn�rent, puis la demie. A la fin, ne sachant plus
       que faire pour attendre, je me dressai sur une chaise, et je pris
       dans un rayon l'_Histoire naturelle_ de M. de Buffon, chose qui
       ne m'�tait jamais arriv�e; puis, les deux coudes sur la table,
       dans une sorte de d�sespoir, je me mis � lire tout seul en
       fran�ais. Il me fallait tout mon app�tit pour me donner une
       pareille id�e; mais � chaque instant je levais la t�te, regardant
       la fen�tre, les yeux tout grands ouverts et pr�tant l'oreille.

       Je venais de trouver l'histoire du moineau, qui poss�de deux fois
       plus de cervelle que l'homme en proportion de son corps, quand
       enfin un bruit lointain, un bruit de grelots se fit entendre, ce
       n'�tait encore qu'un bruissement presque imperceptible, perdu
       dans l'�loignement, mais il se rapprochait vite, et bient�t
       madame Th�r�se dit:

       �C'est M. le docteur.

       --Oui, fit Lisbeth en se levant et remettant son rouet au coin de
       l'horloge; cette fois c'est lui.�

       Elle courut � la cuisine.

       J'�tais d�j� dans l'all�e, abandonnant M. de Buffon sur la table,
       et je tirais la porte ext�rieure en criant:

       �C'est toi, mon oncle?

       --Oui, Fritzel, r�pondit la voix joyeuse de l'oncle, j'arrive.
       Tout s'est bien pass� � la maison?

 65    --Tr�s bien, oncle, tout le monde se porte bien.

       --Bon, bon!�

       Au m�me instant, Lisbeth sortait avec la lanterne, et je vis
       l'oncle sous le hangar, en train de d�teler le cheval.

       �Seigneur Dieu, qu'il fait froid dehors! dit la vieille servante;
       vous devez �tre gel�, monsieur le docteur. Allez, entrez vite
       vous r�chauffer, je finirai bien toute seule.�

       Mais l'oncle Jacob n'avait pas l'habitude de laisser le soin de
       son cheval � d'autres; ce n'est qu'en voyant Rappel devant son
       r�telier garni de foin, et les pieds dans la bonne liti�re, qu'il
       dit:

       �Entrons maintenant.� Et nous entr�mes tous ensemble.

       �Bonnes nouvelles, madame Th�r�se, s'�cria l'oncle sur le seuil,
       bonnes nouvelles! J'arrive de Kaiserslautern, tout va bien
       l�-bas.�

       Madame Th�r�se, assise sur son lit, le regardait toute p�le.

       �Comment, monsieur le docteur, fit-elle, vous venez de
       Kaiserslautern?

       --Oui, j'ai pouss� jusque-l�... J'ai tout vu... je me suis
       inform� de tout, dit-il en souriant; mais je ne vous cache pas,
       madame Th�r�se, que je tombe de fatigue et de faim.�

       Il tirait ses grosses bottes, assis dans le fauteuil, et
       regardait Lisbeth mettre la nappe d'un oeil aussi luisant que
       celui de Scipio et le mien.

       �Tout ce que je puis vous dire, s'�cria-t-il en se relevant,
       c'est que la bataille de Kaiserslautern n'est pas aussi d�cisive
 66    qu'on le croyait, et que votre bataillon n'a pas donn�;[1] le
       petit Jean n'a pas couru de nouveaux dangers.

       --Ah! cela suffit, dit madame Th�r�se, en se recouchant d'un air
       de bonheur et d'attendrissement inexprimables, cela suffit! Vous
       ne m'en diriez pas plus, que je serais d�j� trop heureuse.[2]
       R�chauffez-vous, monsieur le docteur, mangez, ne vous pressez
       pas, je puis attendre maintenant.�

       Lisbeth servait alors la soupe, et l'oncle, en s'asseyant, dit
       encore:

       �Oui, c'est positif, vous pouvez �tre tranquille sur ces deux
       points. Tout � l'heure je vous dirai le reste.�

       Bient�t cependant notre grande faim se ralentit. L'oncle but
       encore un bon coup, puis il alluma sa pipe, et se rapprochant de
       l'alc�ve, il prit la main de madame Th�r�se comme pour lui t�ter
       le pouls, en disant:

       �M'y voil�!�

       Elle ne disait rien et souriait. Alors il commen�a l'histoire de
       la bataille. Je l'�coutais.

       �Les R�publicains sont arriv�s devant Kaiserslautern le 27 au
       soir, dit-il; depuis trois jours les Prussiens y �taient. Les
       Prussiens �taient 40,000 hommes, et les Fran�ais 30,000.

       �Le lendemain donc, l'attaque commen�a sur la gauche; les
       R�publicains, conduits par le g�n�ral Ambert, se mirent � grimper
       le ravin au pas de charge[3] en criant: �Landau[4] ou la mort!�
       Dans ce moment m�me, Hoche devait attaquer le centre; mais il
       �tait couvert de bois et de hauteurs, il lui fut impossible
       d'arriver � temps; le g�n�ral Ambert dut reculer sous le feu des
       Prussiens; il avait toute l'arm�e de Brunswick contre lui. Le
 67    jour suivant, 29 novembre, c'est Hoche qui attaqua par le centre;
       le g�n�ral Ambert devait tourner la droite, mais il s'�gara dans
       les montagnes, de sorte que Hoche fut accabl� � son tour. Malgr�
       cela, l'attaque devait recommencer le lendemain 30 novembre. Ce
       jour-l�, Brunswick fit un mouvement en avant, et les
       R�publicains, de crainte d'�tre coup�s, se mirent en retraite.

       �Voil� ce que je sais de positif, et de la bouche m�me d'un
       commandant r�publicain, bless� d'un coup de feu[1] � la hanche,
       le second jour de la bataille. Le docteur Feuerbach, un de mes
       vieux amis d'Universit�,[2] m'a conduit pr�s de cet homme; sans
       cela je n'aurais rien appris au juste, car des Prussiens on ne
       peut tirer que des vanteries.�

       On pense[3] avec quelle attention madame Th�r�se �coutait ce
       r�cit.

       �Je vois... je vois... disait-elle tristement, la main appuy�e
       contre la tempe, nous avons manqu� d'ensemble.[4]

       --Justement, vous avez manqu� d'ensemble, voil� ce que tout le
       monde dit � Kaiserslautern; mais cela n'emp�che pas que l'on
       reconnaisse le courage et m�me l'audace extraordinaire de vos
       R�publicains. Quand ils criaient: �Landau ou la mort!� au milieu
       du roulement de la fusillade et du grondement des canons, toute
       la ville les entendait, il y avait de quoi[5] vous faire fr�mir.
       Maintenant ils sont en retraite, mais Brunswick n'a pas os� les
       poursuivre.�

       Il y eut un instant de silence, et madame Th�r�se demanda:

       �Et comment savez-vous que notre bataillon n'a pas donn�,
       monsieur le docteur?

 68    --Ah! c'est par le commandant r�publicain; il m'a dit que le
       premier bataillon de la deuxi�me brigade avait �prouv� de grandes
       pertes dans un village de la montagne quelques jours auparavant,
       en poussant une reconnaissance du c�t� de Landau, et que, pour
       cette raison, on l'avait mis � la r�serve. C'est alors que j'ai
       vu qu'il savait exactement les choses.

       --Comment s'appelle ce commandant?

       --Pierre Ronsart.

       --Ah! je le connais bien, je le connais, dit madame Th�r�se, il
       �tait capitaine dans notre bataillon l'ann�e derni�re; comment!
       ce pauvre Ronsart est prisonnier? Est-ce que sa blessure est
       dangereuse?

       --Non, Feuerbach m'a dit qu'il en reviendra; mais il faudra
       quelque temps,� r�pondit l'oncle.

       Puis, souriant d'un air fin, les yeux pliss�s:

       �Oui, oui, fit-il, voil� ce que le commandant m'a racont�. Mais
       il m'a dit bien d'autres choses encore, des choses... des choses
       int�ressantes... extraordinaires... et dont je ne me serais
       jamais dout�...

       --Et quoi donc, monsieur le docteur?

       --Ah! cela m'a bien �tonn�, fit l'oncle en serrant le tabac dans
       sa pipe du bout de son doigt et tirant une grosse bouff�e les
       yeux en l'air, bien �tonn�!... et pourtant pas trop... non, pas
       trop... car des id�es pareilles m'�taient venues quelquefois.

       --Mais quoi donc, monsieur Jacob? fit madame Th�r�se d'un air
       surpris.

       --Ah! il m'a parl� d'une certaine citoyenne Th�r�se, connue de
       toute l'arm�e de la Moselle, et que les soldats appellent tout
 69    bonnement la Citoyenne! H�! h�! h�! il para�t que cette
       citoyenne-l� ne manque pas d'un certain courage!�

       Et se tournant vers Lisbeth et moi:

       �Figurez-vous qu'un jour, comme le chef de leur bataillon venait
       d'�tre tu�, en essayant d'entra�ner ses hommes, et qu'il fallait
       traverser un pont d�fendu par une batterie et deux r�giments
       prussiens, et que tous les plus vieux R�publicains, les plus
       terribles d'entre ces hommes courageux reculaient, figurez-vous
       que cette citoyenne Th�r�se prit le drapeau, et qu'elle marcha
       toute seule sur le pont, en disant � son petit fr�re Jean de
       battre la charge devant elle comme devant une arm�e; ce qui
       produisit un tel effet sur les R�publicains, qu'ils s'�lanc�rent
       tous � sa suite, et s'empar�rent des canons! Comprenez-vous �a,
       vous autres?--C'est le commandant Ronsart qui m'a racont� la
       chose.�

       Et comme nous regardions madame Th�r�se, tout stup�faits, moi
       surtout, les yeux tout grands ouverts, nous v�mes qu'elle
       devenait toute rouge.

       �Ah! fit l'oncle, on apprend tous les jours de nouvelles choses;
       �a, c'est grand; �a, c'est beau! Oui... oui... quoique je sois
       partisan de la paix, �a m'a tout � fait touch�....

       --Mais, monsieur le docteur, r�pondit enfin madame Th�r�se,
       comment pouvez-vous croire?...

       --Oh! interrompit l'oncle en �tendant la main, ce n'est pas ce
       commandant tout seul qui m'a dit cela; deux autres capitaines
       bless�s, qui se trouvaient l�, en entendant dire que la citoyenne
       Th�r�se vivait encore, se sont bien r�jouis. Son histoire du
       drapeau est connue du dernier soldat. Voyons... oui ou non,
 70    est-ce qu'elle a fait �a?� dit l'oncle en fron�ant les sourcils
       et regardant madame Th�r�se en face.

       Alors elle, penchant la t�te, se mit � pleurer en disant:

       �Le chef de bataillon qui venait d'�tre tu� �tait notre p�re...
       nous voulions mourir, le petit Jean et moi... nous �tions
       d�sesp�r�s.�

       En songeant � cela, elle sanglotait. L'oncle, la regardant alors,
       devint tr�s grave et dit:

       �Madame Th�r�se, �coutez, je suis fier d'avoir sauv� la vie d'une
       femme telle que vous. Que ce soit[1] parce que votre p�re �tait
       mort, ou pour toute autre raison que vous ayez agi de la sorte,
       c'�tait toujours grand, noble et courageux; c'�tait m�me
       extraordinaire, car des milliers d'autres femmes se seraient
       content�es de g�mir; elles seraient tomb�es l� sans force, et
       l'on n'aurait pu leur faire de reproches. Mais vous �tes une
       femme courageuse, et longtemps apr�s avoir rempli de grands
       devoirs, vous pleurez lorsque d'autres commencent � oublier; vous
       n'�tes pas seulement la femme qui l�ve le drapeau d'entre les
       morts, vous �tes encore la femme qui pleure, et voil� pourquoi je
       vous estime.--Et je dis que le toit de cette maison, habit�e
       autrefois par mon p�re et mon grand-p�re, est honor� de votre
       pr�sence, oui, honor�!�

       Ainsi parla l'oncle, gravement, en appuyant sur les mots, et
       d�posant sa pipe sur la table, parce qu'il �tait vraiment �mu.

       Et madame Th�r�se finit par dire:

       �Monsieur le docteur, ne parlez pas ainsi, ou je serai forc�e de
       m'en aller. Je vous en prie, ne parlez plus de tout cela.

 71    --Je vous ai dit ce que je pense, r�pondit l'oncle en se levant,
       et maintenant je n'en parlerai plus, puisque telle est votre
       volont�; mais cela ne m'emp�chera pas d'honorer en vous une douce
       et noble cr�ature, et d'�tre fier de vous avoir donn� mes soins.
       Et le commandant m'a dit aussi quel �tait votre p�re et quels
       �taient vos fr�res: des gens simples, na�fs, partis tous ensemble
       pour d�fendre ce qu'ils croyaient �tre la justice. Quand tant de
       milliers d'hommes orgueilleux ne pensent qu'� leurs int�r�ts, et,
       je le dis � regret, quand ils se croient nobles en ne songeant
       qu'aux choses de la mati�re,[1] on aime � voir que la vraie
       noblesse, celle qui vient du d�sint�ressement et de l'h�ro�sme,
       se r�fugie dans le peuple. Qu'ils soient R�publicains ou non,
       qu'importe! je pense, en �me et conscience, que les vrais nobles
       � la face de l'�ternel sont ceux qui remplissent leur devoir.�

       L'oncle, dans son exaltation, allait et venait dans la salle, se
       parlant � lui-m�me. Madame Th�r�se, ayant essuy� ses larmes, le
       regardait en souriant et lui dit:

       �Monsieur le docteur, vous nous avez apport� de bonnes nouvelles,
       merci, merci! Maintenant je vais aller mieux.

       --Oui, r�pondit l'oncle en s'arr�tant, vous irez de mieux en
       mieux. Mais voici l'heure du repos; la fatigue a �t� longue, et
       je crois que ce soir nous dormirons tous bien. Allons, Fritzel,
       allons, Lisbeth, en route! Bonsoir, madame Th�r�se.

       --Bonne nuit, monsieur le docteur.�

       Il prit la chandelle, et monta derri�re nous.

72




                                  XI


       Le lendemain fut un jour de bonheur pour la maison de l'oncle
       Jacob.

       Il �tait bien tard lorsque je m'�veillai de mon profond sommeil;
       j'avais dormi douze heures de suite comme une seconde.

       Je m'habillai aupr�s d'un bon feu, je me lavai avec de l'eau
       ti�de que me versa Lisbeth. L'oncle descendit � son tour, me
       pin�a l'oreille et dit � Lisbeth:

       �Eh bien! eh bien! comment va madame Th�r�se ce matin? La nuit
       s'est bien pass�e, j'esp�re?

       --Entrez, r�pondit la vieille servante d'un accent de bonne
       humeur, entrez, monsieur le docteur, quelqu'un veut vous parler.�

       L'oncle entra, je le suivis, et d'abord nous f�mes tr�s �tonn�s
       de ne voir personne dans la salle, et les rideaux de l'alc�ve
       tir�s.[1] Mais notre �tonnement fut encore bien plus grand
       lorsque, nous �tant retourn�s, nous v�mes madame Th�r�se dans son
       habit de cantini�re, assise derri�re le fourneau; elle �tait
       comme nous l'avions vue la premi�re fois, seulement un peu plus
       p�le. Elle souriait � notre �tonnement, et tenait la main pos�e
       sur la t�te de Scipio assis aupr�s d'elle.

       �Seigneur Dieu![2] fit l'oncle. Comment, c'est vous, madame
       Th�r�se!... Vous �tes lev�e!�

       Puis il ajouta d'un air d'inqui�tude:

       �Quelle imprudence!�

       Mais elle, continuant de sourire, lui tendit la main d'un air de
       reconnaissance, en le regardant de ses grands yeux noirs avec
       expression, et lui r�pondit:

 73    �Ne craignez rien, monsieur le docteur, je suis bien, tr�s bien;
       vos bonnes nouvelles d'hier m'ont rendu la sant�. Voyez
       vous-m�me?...�

       Il lui prit la main en silence et compta le pouls d'un air
       r�veur; puis son front s'�claircit, et d'un ton joyeux il
       s'�cria:

       �Plus de[1] fi�vre! Ah! maintenant, maintenant tout va bien! Mais
       il faut encore de la prudence, encore de la prudence.�

       Et se reculant, il se mit � rire comme un enfant, regardant sa
       malade qui lui souriait aussi:

       �Telle je vous ai vue la premi�re fois, dit-il lentement, telle
       je vous revois, madame Th�r�se. Ah! nous avons eu du bonheur,
       bien du bonheur!

       --C'est vous qui m'avez sauv� la vie, monsieur Jacob, dit-elle,
       les yeux pleins de larmes.�

       Mais hochant la t�te et levant la main:

       �Non, fit-il, non, c'est celui qui conserve tout et qui anime
       tout, c'est celui-l� seul qui vous a sauv�e; car il ne veut pas
       que les grandes et belles natures p�rissent toutes; il veut qu'il
       en reste pour donner l'exemple aux autres. Allons, allons qu'il
       en soit remerci�!�

       Puis changeant de voix et de figure, il s'�cria:

       �R�jouissons-nous!... r�jouissons-nous!... Voil� ce que j'appelle
       un beau jour!�

       En m�me temps il courut � la cuisine, et comme il ne revenait pas
       tout de suite, madame Th�r�se me fit signe d'approcher; elle me
       prit la t�te entre ses mains et m'embrassa, �cartant mes cheveux.

       �Tu es un bon enfant, Fritzel, me dit-elle; tu ressembles � petit
       Jean.�

 74    J'�tais tout fier de ressembler � petit Jean.

       Alors l'oncle rentra, clignant des yeux d'un air de satisfaction
       int�rieure.[1]

       �Aujourd'hui, dit-il, je ne bouge pas de chez nous; il faut aussi
       de temps en temps que l'homme se repose. Je vais seulement faire
       un petit tour au village, pour avoir la conscience nette, et puis
       je rentre passer toute la journ�e en famille....� Puis il sortit
       en nous souriant.

       Madame Th�r�se �tait devenue toute r�veuse; elle se leva, poussa
       le fauteuil pr�s d'une fen�tre, et se mit � regarder la place de
       la fontaine d'un air grave. Moi, je sortis d�jeuner dans la
       cuisine avec Scipio.

       Environ une demi-heure apr�s, j'entendis l'oncle qui rentrait en
       disant:

       �Eh bien! me voil� libre jusqu'au soir, madame Th�r�se; j'ai fait
       ma tourn�e, tout est en ordre, et rien ne m'oblige plus �
       sortir.�

       Depuis un instant, Scipio grattait � la porte, je lui ouvris, et
       nous entr�mes ensemble dans la salle. L'oncle regardait madame
       Th�r�se encore � la m�me place et toute m�lancolique.

       �A quoi pensez-vous donc, madame Th�r�se? lui dit-il, vous avez
       l'air plus triste que tout � l'heure.

       --Je pense, monsieur le docteur, que, malgr� les plus grandes
       souffrances, on est heureux de se sentir encore sur cette terre
       pour quelque temps, dit-elle d'une voix �mue.

       --Pour quelque temps? s'�cria l'oncle, dites donc pour bien des
       ann�es, car, Dieu merci, vous �tes d'une bonne constitution;
       d'ici � peu de jours, vous serez aussi forte qu'autrefois.

 75    --Oui, monsieur Jacob, oui, je le crois, fit-elle; mais quand un
       homme bon, un homme de coeur vous a relev�e d'entre les morts �
       la derni�re minute, c'est un bien grand bonheur de se sentir
       rena�tre, de se dire: �Sans lui, je ne serais plus l�!�

       L'oncle alors comprit qu'elle contemplait le th��tre du terrible
       combat soutenu par son bataillon contre la division autrichienne;
       que toute la place �troite et sombre lui rappelaient les
       incidents de la lutte, et qu'elle savait aussi le sort qui
       l'attendait, si par bonheur il n'�tait survenu quand Joseph Spick
       allait la jeter dans le tombereau. Il resta comme �tourdi de
       cette d�couverte, et seulement au bout d'un instant il demanda:

       �Qui donc vous a racont� ces choses, madame Th�r�se?

       --Hier, pendant que nous �tions seules, Lisbeth m'a dit ce que je
       vous dois de reconnaissance.[1]

       --Lisbeth vous a dit cela! s'�cria l'oncle d�sol�; j'avais
       pourtant bien d�fendu....

       --Ah! ne lui faites pas de reproches, monsieur le docteur,
       dit-elle, je l'ai bien aid�e un peu.... Elle aime tant � causer!�

       Madame Th�r�se souriait alors � l'oncle, qui, s'apaisant
       aussit�t, dit:

       �Allons, allons, j'aurais d� pr�voir cela, n'en parlons plus.
       Mais �coutez-moi bien, madame Th�r�se, il faut chasser ces id�es
       de votre esprit; il faut au contraire t�cher de voir les choses
       en beau.[2] Je voudrais que cette fontaine f�t � l'autre bout du
       village; mais puisqu'elle est l�, et que nous ne pouvons l'�ter,
       allons nous asseoir au coin du fourneau pour ne plus la voir,
       cela vaudra beaucoup mieux.

 76    --Je veux bien,� r�pondit madame Th�r�se en se levant.

       Elle s'appuya sur le bras de l'oncle, qui semblait heureux de la
       soutenir. Moi, je roulai le fauteuil dans son coin, et nous
       repr�mes tous notre place autour du fourneau, dont le p�tillement
       nous r�jouissait.

       Madame Th�r�se dans sa p�leur, ses grands cheveux noirs tombant
       avec des reflets bleu�tres autour de ses �paules, semblait
       heureuse et calme. Nous causions l� tranquillement, l'oncle
       fumait sa grosse pipe de fa�ence[1] avec une gravit� pleine de
       satisfaction.

       �Mais, dites-moi donc, madame Th�r�se, je croyais avoir d�coup�
       votre veste, fit-il au bout de quelques instants, et je la vois
       comme neuve.

       --Nous l'avons recousue hier, Lisbeth et moi, monsieur Jacob,
       r�pondit-elle.

       -- Ah! bon, bon.... Alors vous savez coudre!... Cette id�e ne
       m'�tait pas encore venue.... Je vous voyais toujours � la t�te
       d'un pont, ou quelque part ailleurs, le long d'une rivi�re,
       �clair�e par les coups de fusil.�

       Madame Th�r�se sourit.

       �Je suis la fille d'un pauvre ma�tre d'�cole, dit-elle, et la
       premi�re chose � faire en ce monde, quand on est pauvre, c'est
       d'apprendre � gagner sa vie. Mon p�re le[2] savait, tous ses
       enfants connaissaient un �tat. Il n'y a qu'un an que nous sommes
       partis, et non seulement notre famille, mais tous les jeunes gens
       de la ville et des villages d'alentour, avec des fusils, des
       haches, des fourches et des faux, tout ce qu'on avait, pour aller
       � la rencontre des Prussiens. La proclamation[3] de Brunswick
       avait soulev� tous les pays fronti�res; on apprenait l'exercice
       en route.

 77    Alors mon p�re, un homme instruit, fut nomm� d'abord capitaine �
       l'�lection populaire, et plus tard, apr�s quelques rencontres, il
       devint chef de bataillon. Jusqu'� notre d�part je l'avais aid�
       dans ses classes, je faisais l'�cole des jeunes filles;[1] je les
       instruisais en tout ce que de bonnes m�nag�res doivent savoir.

       �Ah! monsieur Jacob, si l'on m'avait dit dans ce temps-l� qu'un
       jour je marcherais avec des soldats, que je conduirais mon cheval
       par la bride au milieu de la nuit, que je ferais passer ma
       charrette sur des tas de morts, et que souvent, durant des heures
       enti�res, au milieu des t�n�bres, je ne verrais mon chemin qu'�
       la lueur des coups de feu, je n'aurais pu le croire, car je
       n'aimais que les simples devoirs de la famille; j'�tais m�me tr�s
       timide; un regard me faisait rougir malgr� moi. Mais que ne
       fait-on pas quand de grands devoirs nous tirent de l'obscurit�,
       quand la patrie en danger appelle ses enfants! Alors le coeur
       s'�l�ve, on n'est plus le m�me, on marche, la peur s'oublie, et
       longtemps apr�s, on est �tonn� d'�tre si chang�, d'avoir fait
       tant de choses que l'on aurait crues tout � fait impossibles!

       --Oui, oui, faisait l'oncle en inclinant la t�te, maintenant je
       vous connais... je vois les choses clairement.... Ah! c'est ainsi
       qu'on s'est lev�... c'est ainsi que les gens ont march� tous en
       masse. Voyez donc ce que peut faire une id�e!�

       Nous continu�mes � causer de la sorte jusque vers midi; alors
       Lisbeth vint dresser la table et servir le d�ner; nous la
       regardions aller et venir, �tendre la nappe et placer les
       couverts, avec un vrai plaisir, et quand enfin elle apporta la
       soupi�re fumante:

 78    �Allons, madame Th�r�se, s'�cria l'oncle tout joyeux, en se
       levant et l'aidant � marcher, mettons-nous � table.�

       Quand nous f�mes assis les uns en face des autres, il nous sembla
       que tout rentrait dans l'ordre, que tout devait �tre ainsi depuis
       les anciens temps, et que jusqu'� ce jour il nous avait manqu�
       quelqu'un de la famille dont la pr�sence nous rendait plus
       heureux. Lisbeth elle-m�me en apportant le bouilli, les l�gumes
       et le r�ti, s'arr�tait chaque fois � nous contempler d'un air de
       satisfaction profonde, et Scipio se tenait aussi souvent pr�s de
       moi qu'aupr�s de sa ma�tresse, ne faisant plus de diff�rence
       entre nous.

       L'oncle servait madame Th�r�se, et comme elle �tait encore
       faible, il d�coupait lui-m�me les viandes sur son assiette,
       disant:

       �Encore ce petit morceau! Ce qu'il vous faut maintenant, ce sont
       des forces; mangez encore cela, mais ensuite nous en resterons
       l�, car tout doit arriver avec ordre et mesure.�

       La porte s'ouvrit et le mauser et Koffel entr�rent gravement en
       habit des dimanches; ils venaient prendre le caf� avec nous. Il
       �tait facile de voir que l'oncle, en allant les inviter le matin,
       leur avait parl� du courage et de la grande renomm�e de madame
       Th�r�se dans les arm�es de la R�publique, car ils n'�taient plus
       du tout les m�mes. Tous deux avaient la mine de graves
       personnages arrivant pour quelque conf�rence extraordinaire, et
       tous deux salu�rent en se courbant d'un air digne et dirent:

       �Salut bien[1] � la compagnie, salut!

       --Bon, vous voil�, dit l'oncle, venez vous asseoir.�

 79    Puis se tournant vers la cuisine, il s'�cria:

       �Lisbeth, tu peux apporter le caf�.�

       Au m�me instant, regardant par hasard du c�t� des fen�tres, il
       vit passer le vieux Adam Schmitt, et, se levant aussit�t, il alla
       frapper � la vitre, en disant:

       �Voici un vieux soldat de Fr�d�ric, madame Th�r�se; vous serez
       heureuse de faire sa connaissance; c'est un brave homme.�

       Le p�re Schmitt �tait venu voir pourquoi monsieur le docteur
       l'appelait, et l'oncle Jacob, ayant ouvert le ch�ssis, lui dit:

       �P�re Adam, faites-nous donc le plaisir de venir prendre le caf�
       avec nous; j'ai toujours[1] de ce vieux cognac, vous savez?

       --H�! volontiers, monsieur le docteur, r�pondit Schmitt, bien
       volontiers.�

       Puis il parut sur le seuil, la main retourn�e[2] contre
       l'oreille, disant:

       �Pour vous rendre mes devoirs.�

       Lisbeth apporta les tasses et les petites carafes de cognac et de
       kirschenwasser sur un plateau, et cette vue fit se retourner le
       vieux Schmitt, dont les yeux se pliss�rent.[3] Lisbeth apporta la
       cafeti�re, et l'oncle dit:

       �Asseyons-nous.�

       Alors tout le monde s'assit, et madame Th�r�se, souriant � tous
       ces braves gens:

       �Permettez que je vous serve, messieurs,� dit-elle.

       Aussit�t le p�re Schmitt, levant la main � son oreille, r�pondit:

       �A vous les honneurs militaires!�

 80    Koffel et le mauser se lanc�rent un regard d'admiration, et
       chacun pensa: �Ce p�re Schmitt vient de dire une chose pleine
       d'�-propos et de bon sens!�

       Madame Th�r�se emplit donc les tasses, et tandis qu'on buvait en
       silence, l'oncle, pla�ant la main sur l'�paule du p�re Schmitt,
       dit:

       �Madame Th�r�se, je vous pr�sente un vieux soldat du grand
       Fr�d�ric, un homme qui, malgr� ses campagnes et ses blessures,
       son courage et sa bonne conduite, n'est devenu que simple
       sergent, mais que tous les braves gens du village estiment autant
       qu'un _hauptmann_.�

       Alors madame Th�r�se regarda le p�re Schmitt qui s'�tait redress�
       sur sa chaise plein d'un sentiment de dignit� naturelle.

       �Dans les arm�es de la R�publique, Monsieur aurait pu devenir
       g�n�ral, dit-elle. Si la France combat maintenant toute l'Europe,
       c'est qu'elle ne veut plus souffrir que les honneurs, la fortune
       et tous les biens de la terre reposent sur la t�te de
       quelques-uns, malgr� leurs vices, et toutes les mis�res, toutes
       les humiliations sur la t�te des autres, malgr� leur m�rite et
       leurs vertus. La nation trouve cela contraire � la loi de Dieu,
       et c'est pour en obtenir le changement que nous mourrons tous
       s'il le faut.�

       D'abord personne ne r�pondit; Schmitt regardait cette femme
       gravement; il semblait r�fl�chir; le mauser et Koffel, l'un en
       face de l'autre, s'observaient, madame Th�r�se paraissait un peu
       anim�e et l'oncle restait calme.

       Au bout d'un instant, l'oncle Jacob dit � Schmitt:

       �Madame �tait cantini�re au 2e[1] bataillon de la 1re[2] brigade
       de l'arm�e de la Moselle.

 81    --Je le sais d�j�, monsieur le docteur, r�pondit le vieux soldat,
       et je sais aussi ce qu'elle a fait.�

       Puis, �levant la voix, il s'�cria:

       �Oui, Madame, si j'avais eu le bonheur de servir dans les arm�es
       de la R�publique, je serais devenu capitaine, peut-�tre m�me
       commandant, ou je serais mort!�

       Et s'appuyant la main sur la poitrine:

       �J'avais de l'amour-propre, dit-il; sans vouloir me flatter, je
       ne manquais pas de courage, et si j'avais pu monter, j'aurais eu
       honte de rester en bas. Le roi, dans plusieurs occasions, m'avait
       remarqu�, chose bien rare pour un simple soldat, et qui me fait
       honneur. A Rosbach, pendant que le _hauptmann_ derri�re nous
       criait: �_Forvertz!_�[1] c'est Adam Schmitt qui commandait la
       compagnie. Eh bien! tout cela n'a servi � rien; et maintenant,
       quoique je re�oive une pension du roi de Prusse, je suis forc� de
       dire que les R�publicains ont raison. Voil� mon opinion.�

       Alors il vida brusquement son petit verre, et clignant de l'oeil
       d'un air bizarre, il ajouta:

       �Et ils se battent bien... j'ai vu �a... oui, ils se battent
       bien. Ils n'ont pas encore les mouvements r�guliers des vieux
       soldats; mais ils soutiennent bien une charge, et c'est � cela
       qu'on reconna�t les hommes solides dans les rangs.�

       Apr�s ces paroles du p�re Schmitt, chacun se mit � c�l�brer les
       id�es nouvelles; Koffel, qui se plaignait toujours de n'avoir pas
       re�u d'instruction, dit que tous les enfants devraient aller �
       l'�cole aux frais du pays.

       Madame Th�r�se r�pondit que la Convention nationale[2] avait vot�
 82    cinquante-quatre millions de francs pour l'instruction
       publique,--avec le regret de ne pouvoir faire plus,--dans un
       moment o� toute l'Europe se levait contre elle et, o� il lui
       fallait tenir quatorze arm�es sur pied.

       Les yeux de Koffel, en entendant cela, se remplirent de larmes,
       et je me rappellerai toujours qu'il dit d'une voix tremblante:

       �Eh bien! qu'elle soit b�nie! Tant pis pour nous; mais, quand je
       devrais tout y perdre,[1] c'est pour elle que sont mes voeux.�

       Le mauser resta longtemps silencieux, mais une fois qu'il eut
       commenc�, il n'en finit plus; ce n'est pas seulement
       l'instruction des enfants qu'il demandait, lui, c'�tait le
       bouleversement de tout de fond en comble. On n'aurait jamais cru
       qu'un homme si paisible pouvait couver des id�es pareilles.

       �Je dis qu'il est honteux de vendre des r�giments[2] comme des
       troupeaux de boeufs, s'�criait-il d'un ton grave:--je dis qu'il
       est encore plus honteux de vendre des places de juges, parce que
       les juges, pour rentrer dans leur argent, vendent la justice;--je
       dis que les R�publicains ont bien fait d'abolir les couvents, o�
       s'entretiennent la paresse et tous les vices,--et je dis que
       chacun doit �tre libre d'aller, de venir, de commercer, de
       travailler, d'avancer dans tous les grades sans que personne s'y
       oppose. Et finalement je crois que si les frelons ne veulent pas
       s'en aller ni travailler, le bon Dieu veut que les abeilles s'en
       d�barrassent, ce qu'on verra toujours jusqu'� la fin des
       si�cles.�

       Le vieux Schmitt, alors plus � son aise, dit qu'il avait les
 83    m�mes id�es que le mauser et Koffel; et l'oncle, qui jusqu'alors
       avait gard� son calme, ne put s'emp�cher d'approuver ces
       sentiments, les plus vrais, les plus naturels et les plus justes.

       �Seulement, dit-il, au lieu de tout vouloir faire en un jour, il
       vaudrait mieux aller lentement et progressivement; il faudrait
       employer des moyens de persuasion et de douceur, comme l'a fait
       le Christ; ce serait plus sage; et l'on obtiendrait les m�mes
       r�sultats.�

       Madame Th�r�se souriant alors, lui dit:

       �Ah! monsieur Jacob, sans doute, sans doute, si tout le monde
       vous ressemblait; mais depuis combien de centaines d'ann�es le
       Christ a-t-il pr�ch� la bont�, la justice et la douceur aux
       hommes? Et pourtant, voyez si vos nobles l'�coutent; voyez s'ils
       traitent les paysans[1] comme des fr�res... non ... non! C'est
       malheureux, mais il faut la guerre. Dans les trois ans qui
       viennent de se passer, la R�publique a plus fait pour les droits
       de l'homme que les dix-huit cents ans avant. Croyez-moi, monsieur
       le docteur, la r�signation des honn�tes gens est un grand mal,
       elle donne de l'audace aux gueux et ne produit rien de bon.�

       Tous ceux qui se trouvaient l� pensaient comme madame Th�r�se.

       �Moi, dit le p�re Schmitt en se levant, tout ce que je sais,
       c'est que les soldats r�publicains se battent bien, et que si les
       Fran�ais en ont trois ou quatre cent mille comme ceux que j'ai
       vus, j'ai plus peur pour nous que pour eux. Voil� mon id�e.�

       Le mauser se baissa pr�s du fourneau pour ramasser

       une braise, car il �prouvait un grand besoin de fumer. Le vieux
 84    Schmitt suivit son exemple, et comme la nuit �tait venue, ils
       sortirent tous ensemble, Koffel le dernier, en serrant la main de
       l'oncle Jacob et saluant madame Th�r�se.




                                  XII


       Le lendemain, madame Th�r�se s'occupait d�j� des soins du m�nage;
       elle visitait les armoires, d�pliait les nappes, les serviettes,
       et m�me le vieux linge tout jaune entass� l� depuis la grand'm�re
       Lehnel; elle mettait � part ce qu'on pouvait encore r�parer,
       tandis que Lisbeth dressait le grand tonneau[1] plein de cendres
       dans la buanderie. Il fallut faire bouillir de l'eau jusqu'�
       minuit pour la grande lessive. Et les jours suivants, ce fut bien
       autre chose encore, lorsqu'il s'agit de[2] blanchir, de repasser
       et de raccommoder tout cela.

       Madame Th�r�se n'avait pas son �gale pour les travaux de
       l'aiguille; cette femme, qu'on n'avait crue propre qu'� verser
       des verres d'eau-de-vie et � se trimbaler sur une charrette
       derri�re un tas de sans-culottes,[3] en savait plus, touchant les
       choses domestiques, que pas une comm�re d'Anstatt. Elle apporta
       m�me chez nous l'art de broder des guirlandes, et de marquer en
       lettres rouges le beau linge, chose compl�tement ignor�e
       jusqu'alors dans la montagne, et qui prouve combien les grandes
       r�volutions r�pandent la lumi�re.

       De plus, madame Th�r�se aidait Lisbeth � la cuisine sans la
       g�ner, sachant que les vieux domestiques ne peuvent souffrir
       qu'on d�range leurs affaires.

       �Voyez pourtant, madame Th�r�se, lui disait quelque fois la
       vieille servante, comme les id�es changent; dans les premiers
       temps, je ne pouvais pas vous souffrir � cause de votre
 85    R�publique, et maintenant si vous partiez,[4] je croirais que
       toute la maison s'en va, et que nous ne pouvons plus vivre sans
       vous.

       --H�! lui r�pondait-elle en souriant, c'est tout simple, chacun
       tient � ses habitudes; vous ne me connaissiez pas, je vous
       inspirais de la d�fiance; chacun, � votre place, e�t �t� de
       m�me.�

       Puis elle ajoutait tristement:

       �Il faudra pourtant que je parte, Lisbeth, ma place n'est pas
       ici, d'autres soins m'appellent ailleurs.�

       Elle songeait toujours � son bataillon, et, lorsque Lisbeth
       s'�criait:

       �Bah! vous resterez chez nous; vous ne pouvez plus nous quitter
       maintenant. Vous saurez qu'on vous consid�re beaucoup[1] dans le
       village, et que les gens de bien[2] vous respectent. Laissez l�
       vos sans-culottes; ce n'est pas la vie d'une honn�te personne
       d'attraper des balles ou d'autres mauvais coups � la suite des
       soldats. Nous ne vous laisserons plus partir.�

       Alors elle hochait la t�te, et l'on voyait bien qu'un jour ou
       l'autre elle dirait: �Aujourd'hui, je pars!� et que rien ne
       pourrait la retenir.

       D'un autre c�t�, les discussions sur la guerre et sur la paix
       continuaient toujours, et c'�tait l'oncle Jacob qui les
       recommen�ait. Chaque matin il descendait pour convertir madame
       Th�r�se, mais elle trouvait toujours de bonnes r�ponses.

       Chaque fois que l'oncle entendait ces r�ponses, il devenait
       grave. Avait-il une course � faire dans la montagne, il montait �
       cheval tout r�veur, et toute la journ�e il cherchait de nouvelles
       et plus fortes raisons pour convaincre madame Th�r�se. Le soir il
 86    revenait plus joyeux, avec des preuves qu'il croyait invincibles,
       mais sa croyance ne durait pas longtemps; car cette femme simple,
       au lieu de parler des Grecs et des �gyptiens, voyait tout de
       suite le fond des choses, et d�truisait les preuves historiques
       de l'oncle par le bon sens.

       Malgr� tout cela, l'oncle Jacob ne se f�chait pas; au contraire,
       il s'�criait d'un air d'admiration:

       �Quelle femme vous �tes, madame Th�r�se! Sans avoir �tudi� la
       logique, vous r�pondez � tout!�

       Alors ils riaient tous deux ensemble, et madame Th�r�se disait:

       �Vous d�fendez tr�s bien la paix, je suis de votre avis;
       seulement t�chons de nous d�barrasser d'abord de ceux qui veulent
       la guerre, et pour nous en d�barrasser, faisons-la mieux qu'eux.
       Vous et moi nous serions bient�t d'accord, car nous sommes de
       bonne foi, et nous voulons la justice; mais les autres, il faut
       bien les convertir � coups de canon, puisque c'est la seule voix
       qu'ils entendent, et la seule raison qu'ils comprennent.�

       L'oncle ne disait plus rien alors, et, chose qui m'�tonnait
       beaucoup, il avait m�me l'air content d'avoir �t� battu.

       Apr�s ces grandes discussions politiques, ce qui faisait le plus
       de plaisir � l'oncle Jacob, c'�tait de me trouver, au retour de
       ses courses, en train de prendre ma le�on de fran�ais, madame
       Th�r�se assise, le bras autour de ma taille, et moi debout,
       pench� sur le livre. Alors il entrait tout doucement pour ne pas
       nous d�ranger, et s'asseyait en silence derri�re le fourneau,
       allongeant les jambes et pr�tant l'oreille dans une sorte de
       ravissement; il attendait quelquefois une demi-heure avant de
 87    tirer ses bottes et de mettre sa camisole, tant il craignait de
       me distraire, et quand la le�on �tait finie, il s'�criait:

       �A la bonne heure, Fritzel, � la bonne heure, tu prends go�t �
       cette belle langue, que madame Th�r�se t'explique si bien. Quel
       bonheur pour toi d'avoir un ma�tre pareil! Tu ne sauras cela que
       plus tard.�[1]

       Il m'embrassait tout attendri: ce que madame Th�r�se faisait pour
       moi, il l'estimait plus que pour lui-m�me.

       Je dois reconna�tre aussi que cette excellente femme ne
       m'ennuyait pas une minute durant ses le�ons; voyait-elle mon
       attention se lasser, aussit�t elle me racontait de petites
       histoires qui me r�veillaient; elle avait surtout un certain
       cat�chisme r�publicain, plein de traits nobles et touchants,
       d'actions h�ro�ques et de belles sentences, dont le souvenir ne
       s'effacera jamais de ma m�moire.

       Les choses se poursuivirent ainsi plusieurs jours. Le mauser et
       Koffel arrivaient tous les soirs, selon leur habitude; madame
       Th�r�se �tait compl�tement r�tablie, et cela semblait devoir
       durer[2] jusqu'� la consommation des si�cles, lorsqu'un �v�nement
       extraordinaire vint troubler notre qui�tude, et pousser l'oncle
       Jacob aux entreprises les plus audacieuses.




                                 XIII


       Un matin l'oncle Jacob lisait gravement le cat�chisme r�publicain
       derri�re le fourneau; madame Th�r�se cousait pr�s de la fen�tre,
       et moi j'attendais un bon moment pour m'�chapper avec Scipio.

       Dehors, notre voisin Spick fendait du bois; aucun autre bruit ne
       s'entendait au village.

 88    La lecture de l'oncle semblait l'int�resser beaucoup; de temps en
       temps il levait sur nous un regard en disant:

       �Ces R�publicains ont de bonnes choses; ils voient les hommes en
       grand[1]... leurs principes �l�vent l'�me... C'est vraiment beau!
       Quel dommage que de pareilles gens[2] recourent sans cesse � la
       violence!...�

       Alors madame Th�r�se souriait, et l'on se remettait � lire. Cela
       durait depuis environ une demi-heure, lorsque tout � coup un
       homme � cheval s'arr�ta devant notre porte.

       L'oncle venait de d�poser son livre; nous regardions tous cet
       inconnu par les fen�tres.

       �On vient vous chercher pour quelque malade, monsieur le
       docteur,� dit madame Th�r�se.

       L'oncle ne r�pondit pas.

       L'homme, apr�s avoir attach� son cheval au pilier du hangar,
       entrait dans l'all�e.

       �Monsieur le docteur Jacob? fit-il en ouvrant la porte.

       --C'est moi, monsieur.

       --Voici une lettre de la part de[3] M. le docteur Feuerbach, de
       Kaiserslautern.

       -- Veuillez vous asseoir, monsieur,� dit l'oncle.

       L'homme resta debout.

       L'oncle, en relisant la lettre, devint tout p�le et durant une
       minute il parut comme troubl�, regardant madame Th�r�se d'un oeil
       vague.

       �Je dois rapporter la r�ponse s'il y en a, dit l'homme.

       --Vous direz � Feuerbach que je le remercie; c'est toute la
       r�ponse.�

       Puis, sans rien ajouter, il sortit la t�te nue, avec le messager
 89    que nous v�mes s'�loigner dans la rue, conduisant son cheval par
       la bride, vers l'auberge du _Cruchon-d'Or_. Nous v�mes aussi
       l'oncle passer devant les fen�tres et entrer sous le hangar.
       Madame Th�r�se parut alors inqui�te.

       �Fritzel, dit-elle, va porter son bonnet � ton oncle.�

       Je sortis aussit�t et je vis l'oncle qui se promenait de long en
       large devant la grange; il tenait toujours la lettre, sans avoir
       l'id�e de la mettre en poche. Spick, du seuil de la maison, le
       regardait d'un air �trange, les mains crois�es sur sa hache; deux
       ou trois voisins regardaient aussi derri�re leurs vitres.

       Il faisait tr�s froid dehors, je rentrai. Madame Th�r�se avait
       d�pos� son ouvrage et restait pensive, le coude au bord de la
       fen�tre; moi, je m'assis derri�re le fourneau sans avoir envie de
       ressortir.

       Je me rappelle bien que l'oncle rentra quelques instants apr�s,
       en disant que les hommes �taient des gueux, des �tres qui ne
       cherchaient qu'� se[1] nuire; qu'il s'assit � l'int�rieur de la
       petite fen�tre, non loin de la porte, et qu'il se mit � lire la
       lettre de son ami Feuerbach; tandis que madame Th�r�se l'�coutait
       debout � gauche, droite et calme.

       La lettre �tant �crite en allemand de Saxe,[2] tout ce que je pus
       y comprendre, c'est qu'on avait d�nonc� l'oncle Jacob comme un
       jacobin, chez lequel se r�unissaient les gueux du pays pour
       c�l�brer la R�volution;--que madame Th�r�se �tait aussi d�nonc�e
       comme une femme dangereuse, regrett�e des R�publicains � cause de
       son audace extraordinaire, et qu'un officier prussien, accompagn�
       d'une bonne escorte, devait venir la prendre le lendemain et la
       diriger sur Mayence[3] avec les autres prisonniers.

90     Je me rappelle �galement que Feuerbach conseillait � l'oncle une
       grande prudence, parce que les Prussiens, depuis leur victoire de
       Kaiserslautern, �taient ma�tres du pays, qu'ils emmenaient tous
       les gens dangereux, et qu'ils les envoyaient jusqu'en Pologne, �
       deux cents lieues de l�, au fond des marais, pour donner le bon
       exemple aux autres.

       Mais ce qui me parut inconcevable, c'est la fa�on dont l'oncle
       Jacob, cet homme si calme, ce grand amateur de la paix, s'indigna
       contre l'avis et les conseils de son vieux camarade. L'oncle
       accusait Feuerbach d'�tre un �go�ste, pr�t � fl�chir la t�te sous
       l'arrogance des Prussiens, qui traitaient le Palatinat[1] et le
       Hundsr�ck en[2] pays conquis; il s'�criait qu'il existait des
       lois � Mayence, � Tr�ves,[3] � Spire, aussi bien qu'en France;
       que madame Th�r�se avait �t� laiss�e pour morte par les
       Autrichiens; qu'on n'avait pas le droit de r�clamer les personnes
       et les choses abandonn�es; qu'elle �tait libre; qu'il ne
       souffrirait pas qu'on m�t la main sur elle; qu'il protesterait;
       qu'il avait pour ami le jurisconsulte Pfeffel, de Heidelberg;
       qu'il �crirait, qu'il se d�fendrait, qu'il remuerait le ciel et
       la terre; qu'on verrait si Jacob Wagner se laisserait mener de la
       sorte; qu'on serait �tonn� de ce qu'un homme paisible �tait
       capable de faire pour la justice et le droit.

       Madame Th�r�se, pendant ce temps, �tait calme, sa longue figure
       maigre semblait r�veuse. Ce n'est qu'au bout d'une grande
       demi-heure, lorsque l'oncle ouvrit son secr�taire, et qu'il
       s'assit pour �crire au jurisconsulte Pfeffel, qu'elle lui posa
       doucement la main sur l'�paule, et lui dit avec attendrissement:

91     �N'�crivez pas, monsieur Jacob, c'est inutile: avant que votre
       lettre n'arrive, je serai d�j� loin.�

       L'oncle la regardait alors tout p�le.

       �Vous voulez donc partir? fit-il les joues tremblantes.

       --Je suis prisonni�re, dit-elle, je savais cela; mon seul espoir
       �tait que les R�publicains reviendraient � la charge, et qu'ils
       me d�livreraient en marchant sur Landau; mais puisqu'il en est
       autrement, il faut que je parte.

       --Vous voulez partir! r�p�ta l'oncle d'un ton d�sesp�r�.

       --Oui, monsieur le docteur, je veux partir pour vous �pargner de
       grands chagrins; vous �tes trop bon, trop g�n�reux pour
       comprendre les dures lois de la guerre: vous ne voyez que la
       justice! Mais en temps de guerre, la justice n'est rien, la force
       est tout. Les Prussiens sont vainqueurs, ils arrivent, ils
       m'emm�neront parce que c'est leur consigne. Les soldats ne
       connaissent que leur consigne: la loi, la vie, l'honneur, la
       raison des gens ne sont rien; leur consigne passe avant tout.�

       L'oncle, renvers�[1] dans son fauteuil, ses gros yeux pleins de
       larmes, ne savait que r�pondre; seulement il avait pris la main
       de madame Th�r�se et la serrait avec une �motion extraordinaire;
       puis, se relevant la face toute boulevers�e, il se remit �
       marcher, en d�clarant d'une voix de tonnerre que les R�publicains
       avaient raison de se d�fendre, que leur cause �tait juste, qu'il
       le voyait maintenant. Il disait que tout devait �tre aboli de
       fond en comble, que le r�gne du courage et de la vertu devait
       seul triompher, et finalement, dans une sorte d'enthousiasme
       extraordinaire, les bras �tendus vers madame Th�r�se, et les
 92    joues rouges jusqu'� la nuque, il lui proposa de monter avec elle
       sur son tra�neau et de la conduire dans la haute montagne chez un
       b�cheron de ses amis, o� elle serait en s�ret�; il lui tenait les
       deux mains et disait:

       �Partons... allons-nous-en... vous serez tr�s bien chez le vieux
       Ganglof.... C'est un homme qui m'est tout d�vou� ... Je les ai
       sauv�s, lui et son fils... ils vous cacheront.... Les Prussiens
       n'iront pas vous chercher dans les gorges du Lauterfelz!�

       Mais madame Th�r�se refusa, disant que si les Prussiens ne la
       trouvaient pas � Anstatt, ils arr�teraient l'oncle � sa place, et
       qu'elle aimait mieux risquer de p�rir de fatigue et de froid sur
       la grande route que d'exposer � un tel malheur l'homme qui
       l'avait sauv�e d'entre les morts.

       Elle dit cela d'une voix tr�s ferme, mais l'oncle ne tenait plus
       compte alors de semblables raisons. Je me rappelle que ce qui
       l'ennuyait le plus, c'�tait de voir partir madame Th�r�se avec
       des hommes barbares, des sauvages venus du fond de la Pom�ranie;
       il ne pouvait supporter cette id�e et s'�criait:

       �Vous �tes faible... vous �tes encore malade.... Ces Prussiens ne
       respectent rien... c'est une race pleine de jactance et de
       brutalit�.... Vous ne savez pas comment ils traitent leurs
       prisonniers... je l'ai vu, moi... c'est une honte pour mon
       pays.... J'aurais voulu cacher, mais il faut que je l'avoue
       maintenant: c'est affreux!

       --Sans doute, monsieur Jacob, r�pondit-elle, je connais cela par
       d'anciens[1] prisonniers de mon bataillon: nous marcherons deux �
       deux, quatre � quatre, tristes, quelquefois sans pain, souvent
       brutalis�s et press�s par l'escorte. Mais les gens de la campagne
 93    sont bons chez vous, ce sont de braves gens... ils ont de la
       piti�... et les Fran�ais sont gais, monsieur le docteur...il n'y
       aura que la route de p�nible,[2] et encore je trouverai dix,
       vingt de mes camarades pour porter mon petit paquet: les Fran�ais
       ont des �gards pour les femmes.�

       Elle parlait ainsi doucement, la voix un peu tremblante, et �
       mesure qu'elle parlait je la voyais avec son petit paquet dans la
       file des prisonniers, et mon coeur se fendait. Oh! c'est alors
       que je sentis combien nous l'aimions, combien cela nous faisait
       de peine d'�tre forc�s de la voir partir; car tout � coup je me
       pris � fondre en larmes, et l'oncle, s'asseyant en face de son
       secr�taire, les deux mains sur sa figure, resta dans le silence;
       mais de grosses larmes coulaient lentement jusque sur son
       poignet. Madame Th�r�se elle-m�me, voyant ces choses, ne put se
       d�fendre de sangloter; elle me prenait dans ses bras doucement,
       et me donnait de gros baisers en me disant:

       �Ne pleure pas, Fritzel, ne pleure pas ainsi.... Vous penserez
       quelquefois � moi, n'est-ce pas? Moi, je ne vous oublierai
       jamais!�

       Scipio seul restait calme, se promenant autour du fourneau, et
       nous regardant sans rien comprendre � notre chagrin.

       Ce ne fut que vers dix heures, lorsque nous entend�mes Lisbeth
       allumer du feu dans la cuisine, que nous repr�mes un peu de
       calme.

       Alors l'oncle, se mouchant avec force, dit:

       �Madame Th�r�se, vous partirez, puisque vous voulez partir
       absolument; mais il m'est impossible de consentir � ce que ces
       Prussiens viennent vous prendre ici comme une voleuse, et vous
       emm�nent au milieu de tout le village.

 94    Si l'une de ces brutes vous adressait une parole dure ou
       insolente, je m'oublierais... car maintenant ma patience est �
       bout... je le sens, je serais capable de me porter � quelque
       grande extr�mit�. Permettez-moi donc de vous conduire moi-m�me �
       Kaiserslautern avant que ces gens n'arrivent. Nous partirons de
       grand matin, vers quatre ou cinq heures, sur mon tra�neau; nous
       prendrons les chemins de traverse, et � midi au plus tard nous
       serons l�-bas. Y consentez-vous?

       --Oh! monsieur Jacob, comment pourrais-je refuser cette derni�re
       marque de votre affection? dit-elle tout attendrie. J'accepte
       avec reconnaissance.

       --Cela se fera donc de la sorte, dit l'oncle gravement. Et
       maintenant essuyons nos larmes, �cartons autant que possible ces
       pens�es am�res, afin de ne pas trop attrister les derniers
       instants que nous passerons ensemble.�

       Il vint m'embrasser, �carta les cheveux de mon front et dit:

       �Fritzel, tu es un bon enfant, tu as un excellent coeur.
       Rappelle-toi que ton oncle Jacob a �t� content de toi en ce jour:
       c'est une bonne pens�e de se dire qu'on a donn� de la
       satisfaction � ceux qui nous aiment!�




                                  XIV


       Depuis cet instant le calme se r�tablit chez nous. Chacun
       songeait au d�part de madame Th�r�se, au grand vide que cela
       ferait dans notre maison, � la tristesse qui succ�derait pendant
       des semaines et des mois aux bonnes soir�es que nous avions
 95    pass�es ensemble, � la douleur du mauser, de Koffel et du vieux
       Schmitt en apprenant cette mauvaise nouvelle; plus on r�vait,
       plus on d�couvrait de nouveaux sujets d'�tre d�sol�.

       Moi, ce qui me semblait le plus amer, c'�tait de quitter mon ami
       Scipio; je n'osais pas le dire, mais en pensant qu'il allait
       partir, que je ne pourrais plus me promener avec lui dans le
       village, au milieu de l'admiration universelle, que je n'aurais
       plus le bonheur de lui voir faire l'exercice, et que je serais
       comme avant, seul � me promener les mains dans les poches et le
       bonnet de coton tir� sur les oreilles, sans honneur et sans
       gloire, un tel d�sastre me semblait le comble de la d�solation.
       Et ce qui finissait de m'abreuver d'amertume,[1] c'est que
       Scipio, grave et pensif, �tait venu s'asseoir devant moi, me
       regardant � travers ses �pais sourcils fris�s, d'un air aussi
       chagrin que s'il e�t compris qu'il fallait nous s�parer dans les
       si�cles des si�cles.[2] Oh! quand je pense � ces choses, encore
       aujourd'hui je m'�tonne que les grosses boucles blondes de mes
       cheveux ne soient pas devenues toutes grises, au milieu de ces
       r�flexions d�solantes. Je ne pouvais pas m�me pleurer, tant ma
       douleur �tait cruelle; je restais le nez en l'air, mes grosses
       l�vres retrouss�es, et mes deux mains crois�es autour d'un genou.

       L'oncle, lui, se promenait de long en large, et de temps en temps
       il toussait tout bas en redoublant de marcher.

       Madame Th�r�se, toujours active, malgr� sa tristesse et ses yeux
       rouges, avait ouvert l'armoire du vieux linge, et se[3] taillait,
       dans de la grosse toile, une esp�ce de sac � doubles bretelles
       pour mettre ses effets de route.

       Lisbeth �tant venue vers midi mettre la nappe, l'oncle s'arr�ta
       et lui dit:

 96    �Tu feras cuire un petit jambon pour demain matin; madame Th�r�se
       part.�

       Et comme la vieille servante le regardait toute saisie:

       �Les Prussiens la r�clament, dit-il d'une voix enrou�e; ils ont
       la force pour eux... il faut ob�ir.�

       Alors Lisbeth d�posa ses assiettes au bord de la table et, nous
       regardant l'un apr�s l'autre, elle releva son bonnet sur sa t�te,
       comme si cette nouvelle avait pu le d�ranger, puis elle dit:

       �Madame Th�r�se part... �a n'est pas possible... je ne croirai
       jamais cela.

       --Il le faut, ma pauvre Lisbeth, r�pondit madame Th�r�se
       tristement, il le faut, je suis prisonni�re... on vient me
       chercher.

       --Les Prussiens?

       --Oui, les Prussiens.�

       Alors la vieille, que l'indignation suffoquait, dit:

       �J'ai toujours pens� que ces Prussiens n'�taient pas grand'chose:
       des tas de gueux, de v�ritables bandits! Venir attaquer une
       honn�te femme! Si les hommes avaient pour deux liards[1] de
       coeur, est-ce qu'ils souffriraient �a?

       -- Et que ferais-tu? lui demanda l'oncle, dont la face se
       ranimait, car l'indignation de la vieille lui faisait plaisir
       int�rieurement.

       --Moi, je chargerais mes _kougelreiter_,[2] s'�cria Lisbeth je
       leur dirais par la fen�tre: �Passez votre chemin, bandits!
       n'entrez pas, ou gare!� Et le premier qui d�passerait la porte,
       je l'�tendrais raide. Oh! les gueux!

       --Oui, oui, fit l'oncle, voil� comment on devrait recevoir des
       gens pareils; mais nous ne sommes pas les plus forts.�

 97    Puis il se remit � marcher, et Lisbeth, toute tremblante, pla�a
       les couverts.

       Madame Th�r�se ne disait rien.

       La table mise, nous d�n�mes tout r�veurs.

       Apr�s d�ner, l'oncle recommanda surtout � la vieille servante de
       ne pas r�pandre le bruit de ces �v�nements au village, sans quoi
       Richter et tous les gueux d'Anstatt seraient l� le lendemain de
       bonne heure pour voir le d�part de madame Th�r�se et jouir de
       notre humiliation. Elle le comprit tr�s bien et lui promit de
       mod�rer sa langue. Puis l'oncle sortit pour aller voir le mauser.

       Toute cette apr�s-midi, je ne quittai pas la maison. Madame
       Th�r�se continua ses pr�paratifs de d�part.

       Elle paraissait de bonne humeur, et seulement lorsqu'elle
       adressait de temps en temps � Scipio quelques paroles amicales,
       sa voix devenait toute m�lancolique; je ne savais pas pourquoi;
       mais je le sus plus tard, lorsque l'oncle revint.

       La nuit �tait venue, lorsque l'oncle ouvrit la porte, en
       demandant:

       ��tes-vous l�, madame Th�r�se?

       --Oui, monsieur le docteur.

       --Bon... bon.... J'ai vu mes malades... j'ai pr�venu Koffel, le
       mauser et le vieux Schmitt; tout va bien; ils seront ici ce soir
       pour recevoir vos adieux.�

       Sa voix �tait raffermie. Il alla lui-m�me chercher de la lumi�re
       � la cuisine, et, nous voyant ensemble en rentrant, cela parut le
       r�jouir.

       �Fritzel se conduit bien, dit-il. Maintenant il va perdre vos
       bonnes le�ons; mais j'esp�re qu'il s'exercera tout seul � lire en
 98    fran�ais, et qu'il se rappellera toujours qu'un homme ne vaut que
       par ses connaissances.[1] Je compte l�-dessus.�

       Alors madame Th�r�se lui fit voir son petit paquet en d�tail;
       elle souriait, et l'oncle disait:

       �Quel heureux caract�re ont ces Fran�ais! Au milieu des plus
       grandes infortunes, ils conservent un fond de gaiet� naturelle;
       leur d�solation ne dure jamais plusieurs jours. Voil� ce que
       j'appelle un pr�sent de Dieu, le plus beau, le plus d�sirable de
       tous.�

       Mais de cette journ�e,--dont le souvenir ne s'effacera jamais de
       ma m�moire, parce qu'elle fut la premi�re o� je vis la tristesse
       de ceux que j'aimais;--de tout ce jour, ce qui m'attendrit le
       plus, ce fut quelques instants avant le souper, lorsque,
       tranquillement assise derri�re le po�le, la t�te de Scipio sur
       les genoux, et regardant au fond de la salle obscure d'un air
       r�veur, madame Th�r�se se prit tout � coup � dire:

       �Monsieur le docteur, je vous dois bien des choses... et
       cependant il faut que je vous fasse encore une demande.

       --Quoi donc, madame Th�r�se?

       --C'est de garder aupr�s de vous mon pauvre Scipio... de le
       garder en souvenir de moi.... Qu'il soit le compagnon de Fritzel,
       comme il a �t� le mien, et qu'il n'ait pas � supporter les
       nouvelles �preuves de ma vie de prisonni�re.�

       Comme elle disait cela, je crus sentir mon coeur se gonfler, et
       je fr�mis de bonheur et de tendresse jusqu'au fond des
       entrailles.[2] J'�tais accroupi sur ma petite chaise basse devant
       le fourneau; je pris mon Scipio, je l'attirai, j'enfon�ai mes
       deux grosses mains rouges dans son �paisse toison, un v�ritable
 99    d�luge de larmes inonda mes joues; il me semblait qu'on venait de
       me rendre tous les biens de la terre et du ciel que j'avais
       perdus.

       L'oncle me regardait tout surpris; il comprit sans doute ce que
       j'avais souffert en songeant qu'il fallait me s�parer de Scipio,
       car, au lieu de faire des observations � madame Th�r�se sur le
       sacrifice qu'elle s'imposait, il dit simplement:

       �J'accepte, madame Th�r�se, j'accepte pour Fritzel, afin qu'il se
       souvienne combien vous l'avez aim�; qu'il se rappelle toujours
       que, dans le plus grand chagrin, vous lui avez laiss�, comme
       marque de votre affection, un �tre bon, fid�le, non seulement
       votre propre compagnon, mais encore celui de petit Jean, votre
       fr�re; qu'il ne l'oublie jamais et qu'il vous aime aussi.�

       Puis, s'adressant � moi:

       �Fritzel, dit-il, tu ne remercies pas madame Th�r�se?�

       Alors je me levai, et, sans pouvoir dire un mot tant je
       sanglotais, j'allai me jeter dans les bras de cette excellente
       femme et je ne la quittai plus; je me tenais pr�s d'elle, le bras
       sur son �paule, regardant � nos pieds Scipio � travers de grosses
       larmes, et le touchant du bout des doigts avec un sentiment de
       joie inexprimable.

       Il fallut du temps pour m'apaiser. Madame Th�r�se, en
       m'embrassant, disait: �Cet enfant a bon coeur, il s'attache
       facilement, c'est bien!� ce qui redoublait encore mes pleurs.
       Elle �cartait mes cheveux de mon front et semblait attendrie.

       Enfin, sur le coup de neuf heures, l'oncle dit:

       �Il se fait tard... il faudra partir avant le jour.... Je crois
       que nous ferions bien d'aller prendre un peu de repos.�

100    L'oncle, sur le seuil de ma chambre, m'embrassa et me dit d'une
       voix �trange, en me serrant sur son coeur:

       �Fritzel... travaille... travaille... et conduis-toi bien, cher
       enfant!�

       Il entra chez lui tout �mu.

       Moi, je ne pensais qu'au bonheur de garder Scipio. Une fois dans
       ma chambre, je le fis coucher � mes pieds, entre le chaud duvet
       et le bois de lit;[1] il se tenait l� tranquille, la t�te entre
       les pattes; je sentais ses flancs se dilater doucement � chaque
       respiration, et je n'aurais pas chang� mon sort contre celui de
       l'empereur d'Allemagne.

       Jusque pass� dix heures, il me fut impossible de dormir, en
       songeant � ma f�licit�. L'oncle allait et venait chez lui; je
       l'entendis ouvrir son secr�taire, puis faire du feu dans le po�le
       de sa chambre pour la premi�re fois de l'hiver; je pensai qu'il
       avait l'id�e de veiller, et je finis par m'endormir profond�ment.




                                  XV


       Neuf heures sonnaient � l'�glise, lorsque je fus �veill� par un
       cliquetis de ferraille devant notre maison; des chevaux
       pi�tinaient sur la terre durcie, on entendait des gens parler �
       notre porte.

       L'id�e me vint aussit�t que les Prussiens arrivaient pour prendre
       madame Th�r�se, et je souhaitai de tout mon coeur que l'oncle
       Jacob n'e�t pas aussi longtemps dormi que moi. Deux minutes
       apr�s, je descendais l'escalier, et je d�couvrais au bout de
       l'all�e cinq ou six hussards. L'officier, un petit blond tr�s
101    maigre, les joues creuses, les pommettes plaqu�es de rose et les
       grosses moustaches d'un roux fauve, se tenait en travers de
       l'all�e sur un grand cheval noir, et Lisbeth, le balai � la main,
       r�pondait � ses questions d'un air effray�.

       Plus loin, s'�tendait un cercle de gens, la bouche b�ante, se
       penchant l'un sur l'autre pour entendre. Au premier rang, je
       remarquai le mauser, les mains dans les poches, et M. Richter qui
       souriait, les yeux pliss�s et les dents d�couvertes, comme un
       vieux renard en jubilation. Il �tait venu sans doute pour jouir
       de la confusion de l'oncle.

       �Ainsi, votre ma�tre et la prisonni�re sont partis ensemble ce
       matin? disait l'officier.

       --Oui, monsieur le commandant, r�pondit Lisbeth.

       --A quelle heure?

       --Entre cinq et six heures, monsieur le commandant; il faisait
       encore nuit; j'ai moi-m�me accroch� la lanterne au tra�neau.

       --Vous aviez donc re�u l'avis de notre arriv�e?� dit l'officier
       en lui lan�ant un coup d'oeil per�ant.

       Lisbeth regarda le mauser, qui sortit du cercle et r�pondit pour
       elle sans g�ne.

       �Sauf votre respect,[1] j'ai vu le docteur Jacob hier soir; c'est
       un de mes amis.... Cette pauvre vieille ne sait rien.... Depuis
       longtemps le docteur �tait las de la Fran�aise, il avait envie de
       s'en d�barrasser, et quand il a vu qu'elle pouvait supporter le
       voyage, il a profit� du premier moment.

       --Mais comment ne les avons-nous pas rencontr�s sur la route?
       s'�cria le Prussien en regardant le mauser de la t�te aux pieds.

102    --H�! vous aurez pris le chemin de la vall�e, le docteur aura
       pass� par le Waldeck et la montagne; il y a plus d'un chemin pour
       aller � Kaiserslautern.�

       L'officier, sans r�pondre, sauta de son cheval; il entra dans
       notre chambre, poussa la porte de la cuisine et fit semblant de
       regarder � droite et � gauche; puis il ressortit et dit en se
       remettant en selle:

       �Allons, voil� notre affaire faite; le reste ne nous regarde
       plus.�

       Il se dirigea vers le _Cruchon-d'Or_, ses hommes le suivirent, et
       la foule se dispersa, causant de ces �v�nements extraordinaires.
       Richter semblait confus et comme indign�, Spick nous regardait
       d'un oeil louche; ils remont�rent ensemble les marches de
       l'auberge, et Scipio, qui s'�tait tenu sur notre escalier, sortit
       alors en aboyant de toutes ses forces.

       Les hussards se rafra�chirent au _Cruchon-d'Or_, puis nous les
       rev�mes passer devant chez nous, sur la route de Kaiserslautern,
       et depuis nous n'en e�mes plus de nouvelles.

       Lisbeth et moi nous pensions que l'oncle reviendrait � la nuit;
       mais quand nous v�mes s'�couler tout le jour, puis le lendemain
       et le surlendemain sans m�me recevoir de lettre, on peut
       s'imaginer notre inqui�tude.

       Scipio montait et descendait dans la maison; il se tenait le nez
       au bas de la porte du matin au soir, appelant madame Th�r�se,
       reniflant et pleurant d'un ton lamentable. Sa d�solation nous
       gagnait; mille id�es de malheurs nous passaient par la t�te.

       Le mauser venait nous voir tous les soirs et nous disait:

       �Bah! tout cela n'est rien; le docteur a voulu recommander madame
103    Th�r�se; il ne pouvait pas la laisser partir avec les
       prisonniers, c'�tait contraire au bon sens; il aura demand�[1]
       une audience au feld-mar�chal Brunswick, pour t�cher de la faire
       entrer � l'h�pital de Kaiserslautern.... Toutes ces d�marches
       demandent du temps.... Tranquillisez-vous, il reviendra.�

       Ces paroles nous rassuraient un peu, car le taupier semblait tr�s
       calme; il fumait sa pipe au coin du fourneau, les jambes �tendues
       et la mine r�veuse.

       Malheureusement le garde forestier[2] Roedig, qui demeurait dans
       les bois, sur le chemin de Pirmasens, o� se trouvaient alors les
       Fran�ais, vint apporter un rapport � la mairie d'Anstatt, et,
       s'�tant arr�t� quelques instants � l'auberge de Spick, il raconta
       que l'oncle Jacob avait pass�, trois jours auparavant, vers huit
       heures du matin, devant la maison foresti�re et qu'il s'y �tait
       m�me arr�t� un instant avec madame Th�r�se, pour se r�chauffer et
       boire un verre de vin. Il dit aussi que l'oncle paraissait tout
       joyeux, et qu'il avait deux longs _kougelreiter_ dans les poches
       de sa houppelande.

       Alors le bruit courut que le docteur Jacob, au lieu de se rendre
       � Kaiserslautern, avait conduit la prisonni�re chez les
       R�publicains, et ce fut un grand scandale; Richter et Spick
       criaient partout qu'il m�ritait d'�tre fusill�, que c'�tait une
       abomination, et qu'il fallait confisquer ses biens.

       Le mauser et Koffel r�pondaient que le docteur s'�tait sans doute
       tromp� de chemin � cause des grands neiges, qu'il avait pris �
       gauche dans la montagne, au lieu de tourner � droite, mais chacun
       savait bien que l'oncle Jacob connaissait le pays comme pas un
       contrebandier,[3] et l'indignation augmentait de jour en jour.

104    Je ne pouvais plus sortir sans entendre mes camarades crier que
       l'oncle Jacob �tait un jacobin; il me fallait livrer bataille
       pour le d�fendre, et malgr� le secours de Scipio, je rentrai plus
       d'une fois � la maison le nez meurtri.

       C'�tait bien triste. Le mauser seul conservait son air
       tranquille.

       �Vous �tes des fous de vous faire du mauvais sang, disait-il; je
       vous r�p�te que le docteur Jacob se porte bien et qu'on ne
       confisquera rien du tout. Tenez-vous en paix, mangez bien, dormez
       bien, et pour le reste, j'en[2] r�ponds.�

       Malgr� ces assurances, tout allait de mal en pis, et la racaille
       du village, excit�e par ce gueux de Richter, commen�ait � venir
       crier sous nos fen�tres, lorsqu'un beau matin tout rentra
       subitement dans l'ordre. Vers le soir le mauser arriva, la mine
       riante, et prit sa place ordinaire en disant � Lisbeth qui
       filait:

       �Eh bien, on ne crie plus, on ne veut plus nous confisquer, on se
       tient bien tranquille, h�! h�! h�!�

       Il n'en dit pas davantage, mais dans la nuit nous entend�mes des
       voitures passer en foule, des gens marcher en masse par la grande
       rue; c'�tait pire qu'� l'arriv�e des R�publicains, car personne
       ne s'arr�tait: on allait... on allait toujours!

       Je ne pus dormir une minute, Scipio � chaque instant grondait. Au
       petit jour, ayant regard� par nos vitres, je vis encore une
       dizaine de grandes voitures charg�es de bless�s s'�loigner en
       cahotant. C'�taient des Prussiens. Puis arriv�rent deux ou trois
       canons, puis une centaine de hussards, de cuirassiers, de
       dragons, p�le-m�le dans un grand d�sordre; puis des cavaliers
       d�mont�s, leur porte-manteau sur l'�paule et couverts de boue
105    jusqu'� l'�chine. Tous ces hommes semblaient harass�s; mais ils
       ne s'arr�taient pas, ils n'entraient pas dans les maisons, et
       marchaient comme s'ils avaient eu le diable � leurs trousses.

       Les gens, sur le seuil de leur porte, regardaient cela d'un air
       morne.

       C'�tait l'arm�e du feld-mar�chal Brunswick en retraite apr�s la
       bataille de Froeschwiller, comme nous l'avons appris plus tard;
       elle avait travers� le village dans une seule nuit. Cela se
       passait du 28 au 29 d�cembre, et si je me le rappelle si bien,
       c'est que[1] le lendemain de bonne heure, le mauser et Koffel
       arriv�rent tout joyeux, ils avaient une lettre de l'oncle Jacob,
       et le mauser, en nous la montrant, dit:

       �H�! h�! h�! �a va bien... �a va bien! le r�gne de la Justice et
       de l'�galit� commence.... �coutez un peu!�

       Il s'assit devant notre table, les deux coudes �cart�s. J'�tais
       pr�s de lui et je lisais par-dessus son �paule; Lisbeth, toute
       p�le, �coutait derri�re, et Koffel, debout contre la vieille
       armoire, souriait en se caressant le menton. Ils avaient d�j� lu
       la lettre deux ou trois fois, le mauser la savait presque par
       coeur.

       Donc[2] il lut ce qui suit, en s'arr�tant parfois pour nous
       regarder d'un air d'enthousiasme:

                "Wissembourg, le 8 niv�se,[3] an II[4]
                    de la R�publique fran�aise."

       �Aux citoyens Mauser et Koffel, � la citoyenne Lisbeth, au petit
       citoyen Fritzel, salut et fraternit�!

       �La citoyenne Th�r�se et moi nous vous souhaitons d'abord joie,
       concorde et prosp�rit�.

106    �Vous saurez ensuite que nous vous �crivons ces lignes de
       Wissembourg, au milieu des triomphes de la guerre; nous avons
       chass� les Prussiens de Froeschwiller, et nous sommes tomb�s sur
       les Autrichiens au Geisberg comme le tonnerre.

       �Ainsi l'orgueil et la pr�somption re�oivent leur r�compense;
       quand les gens ne veulent pas entendre de bonnes raisons, il faut
       bien leur en donner de meilleures; mais c'est terrible d'en venir
       � de telles extr�mit�s, oui, c'est terrible!

       �Mes chers amis, depuis longtemps je g�missais en moi-m�me sur
       l'aveuglement de ceux qui dirigent les destin�es de la vieille
       Allemagne; je d�plorais leur esprit d'injustice, leur �go�sme; je
       me demandais si mon devoir d'honn�te homme[1] n'�tait pas de
       rompre avec tous ces �tres orgueilleux, et d'adopter les
       principes de justice, d'�galit� et fraternit� proclam�s par la
       R�volution fran�aise. Tout cela me jetait dans un grand trouble,
       car l'homme tient aux id�es qu'il a re�ues de ses p�res, et de
       telles r�volutions int�rieures ne se font pas sans un grand
       d�chirement. N�anmoins j'h�sitais encore, mais lorsque les
       Prussiens, contrairement au droit des gens, r�clam�rent la
       malheureuse prisonni�re que j'avais recueillie, je ne pus en
       supporter davantage: au lieu de conduire madame Th�r�se �
       Kaiserslautern, je pris aussit�t la r�solution de la mener �
       Pirmasens, chose que j'ai faite avec l'aide de Dieu.

       �A trois heures de l'apr�s-midi, nous �tions en vue des
       avant-postes, et comme madame Th�r�se regardait, elle entendit le
       tambour et s'�cria: �Ce sont les Fran�ais! Monsieur le docteur,
107    vous m'avez tromp�e!� Elle se jeta dans mes bras, fondant en
       larmes, et je me pris moi-m�me � pleurer, tant j'�tais �mu!

       �Sur toute la route, depuis les _Trois-Maisons_[1] jusqu'� la
       place du Temple-Neuf, les soldats criaient: �Voici la citoyenne
       Th�r�se!� Ils nous suivaient, et quand il fallut descendre du
       tra�neau, plusieurs m'embrass�rent avec une v�ritable effusion.
       D'autres me serraient les mains, enfin on m'accablait d'honneurs.

       �Je ne vous parlerai pas, mes chers amis, de la rencontre de
       madame Th�r�se et du petit Jean; ces choses ne sont pas �
       peindre! Tous les plus vieux soldats du bataillon, m�me le
       commandant Duch�ne, qui n'est pas tendre, d�tournaient la t�te
       pour ne pas montrer leurs larmes: c'�tait un spectacle comme je
       n'en ai jamais vu de ma vie. Le petit Jean est un brave gar�on;
       il ressemble beaucoup � mon cher petit Fritzel, aussi je l'aime
       bien.

       �Le g�n�ral Hoche, ayant appris qu'un m�decin d'Anstatt avait
       ramen� la citoyenne Th�r�se au premier bataillon de la deuxi�me
       brigade, je re�us l'ordre, vers huit heures, d'aller �
       l'Orangerie.[2] Il �tait l�, pr�s d'une table de sapin, habill�
       comme un simple _hauptmann_, avec deux autres citoyens qu'on m'a
       dit �tre les conventionnels[3] Lacoste et Baudot, deux grands
       maigres, qui me regardaient de travers.--Le g�n�ral vint � ma
       rencontre: c'est un homme brun, les yeux jaunes et les cheveux
       partag�s au milieu du front; il s'arr�ta en face de moi et me
       regarda deux secondes. Moi, songeant que ce jeune homme
       commandait l'arm�e de la Moselle, j'�tais troubl�; mais tout �
       coup il me tendit la main et me dit: �Docteur Wagner, je vous
       remercie de ce que vous avez fait pour la citoyenne Th�r�se: vous
       �tes un homme de coeur.

108    �Puis il m'emmena pr�s de la table, o� se trouvait d�ploy�e une
       carte, et me demanda diff�rents renseignements sur le pays d'une
       fa�on si claire, qu'on aurait cru qu'il connaissait les choses
       bien mieux que moi. Naturellement je r�pondais; les deux autres
       �coutaient en silence. Finalement, il me dit: Docteur Wagner, je
       ne puis vous proposer de servir dans les arm�es de la R�publique,
       votre nationalit�[1] s'y oppose; mais le 1er bataillon de la 2e
       brigade vient de perdre son chirurgien-major, le service de nos
       ambulances est encore incomplet, nous n'avons que des jeunes gens
       pour secourir nos bless�s, je vous confie ce poste d'honneur:
       l'humanit� n'a pas de patrie! Voici votre commission.� Il �crivit
       quelques mots au bout de la table,[2] et me prit encore une fois
       la main en me disant: �Docteur, croyez � mon estime!� Apr�s cela,
       je sortis.

       �Madame Th�r�se m'attendait dehors, et quand elle sut que
       j'allais �tre � la t�te de l'ambulance du 1er bataillon, vous
       pouvez vous figurer sa joie.

       �Nous pensions tous rester � Pirmasens jusqu'au printemps, les
       baraques �taient en train de se b�tir, quand dans la nuit du
       surlendemain, vers dix heures, tout � coup nous re��mes l'ordre
       de nous mettre en route sans �teindre les feux, sans faire de
       bruit, sans battre la caisse ni sonner de la trompette. Tout
       Pirmasens dormait. J'avais deux chevaux, l'un sous moi, l'autre
       en main; j'�tais au milieu des officiers, pr�s du commandant
       Duch�ne.

       �Nous partons, les uns � cheval, les autres � pied, les canons,
       les caissons, les voitures entre nous, la cavalerie sur les
109    flancs, sans lune et sans rien pour nous guider. Seulement, de
       loin en loin, un cavalier au tournant des chemins disait: �Par
       ici... par ici!...�

       �Mais nous allions, nous allions sans nous arr�ter, de sorte que
       vers six heures, quand le soleil p�le se mit � blanchir le ciel,
       nous �tions � Lembach, sous la grande c�te bois�e de Steinfelz, �
       trois quarts de lieue de Woerth. Alors, de tous les c�t�s on
       entendit crier: �Halte!... halte!...� Ceux de derri�re arrivaient
       toujours; � six heures et demie toute l'arm�e �tait r�unie dans
       un vallon, et l'on se mit � faire la soupe.

       �Le g�n�ral Hoche, que j'ai vu passer alors avec ses deux grands
       conventionnels, riait; il semblait de bonne humeur.

       �Cette halte dura juste le temps de manger et de reboucler son
       sac. Ensuite il fallut repartir mieux en ordre.

       �A huit heures, en sortant de la vall�e de Reichshofen, nous
       v�mes les Prussiens retranch�s sur les hauteurs de Froeschwiller
       et de Woerth; ils �taient plus de vingt mille, et leurs redoutes
       s'�levaient les unes au-dessus des autres.

       �Toute l'arm�e comprit alors que nous avions march� si vite pour
       surprendre ces Prussiens seuls, car les Autrichiens �taient �
       quatre ou cinq lieues de l�, sur la ligne de la Motter. Malgr�
       cela, je ne vous cache pas, mes amis, que cette vue me porta
       d'abord un coup terrible; plus je regardais, plus il me semblait
       impossible de gagner la bataille. D'abord ils �taient plus
       nombreux que nous, ensuite ils avaient creus� des foss�s garnis
       de palissades, et derri�re on voyait tr�s bien les canonniers qui
       se penchaient � c�t� de leurs canons et qui nous observaient,
       tandis que des files de ba�onnettes innombrables se prolongeaient
       jusque sur la c�te.

110    �Les Fran�ais, avec leur caract�re insouciant, ne voyaient pas
       tout cela et paraissaient m�me tr�s joyeux. Le bruit s'�tant
       r�pandu que le g�n�ral Hoche venait de promettre six cents francs
       pour chaque pi�ce enlev�e � l'ennemi, ils riaient en se mettant
       le chapeau sur l'oreille, et regardaient les canons en criant:
       �Adjug�! adjug�!�[1] Il y avait de quoi fr�mir de voir une
       pareille insouciance et d'entendre ces plaisanteries.

       �Nous autres, l'ambulance, les voitures de toute sorte, les
       caissons vides pour transporter les bless�s, nous rest�mes
       derri�re, et pour dire la v�rit�, cela me fit un v�ritable
       plaisir. Madame Th�r�se embrassait alors le petit Jean, qui se
       mit � courir pour suivre le bataillon.

       �Toute la vall�e, � droite et � gauche, �tait pleine de cavalerie
       en bon ordre. Le g�n�ral Hoche, en arrivant, choisit lui-m�me
       tout de suite la place de deux batteries sur les collines de
       Reichshofen, et l'infanterie fit halte au milieu de la vall�e.

       �Il y eut encore une d�lib�ration, puis toute l'infanterie se
       rangea en trois colonnes; l'une passa sur la gauche, dans la
       gorge de R�ebach, les deux autres se mirent en marche sur les
       retranchements l'arme au bras.

       �Le g�n�ral Hoche, avec quelques officiers, se pla�a sur une
       petite hauteur, � gauche de la vall�e.

       �Tout ce qui suivit, mes chers amis, me semble encore un r�ve. Au
       moment o� les colonnes arrivaient au pied de la c�te, un horrible
       fracas, comme une esp�ce de d�chirement �pouvantable, retentit;
       tout fut couvert de fum�e: c'�taient les Prussiens qui venaient
       de l�cher leurs batteries. Une seconde apr�s, la fum�e s'�tant un
       peu dissip�e, nous v�mes les Fran�ais plus haut sur la c�te.

111    �Pour la seconde fois les Prussiens tir�rent, puis on entendit le
       cri terrible des R�publicains: �_A la ba�onnette!_�[1] Et toute
       la montagne se mit � p�tiller comme un feu de charbonni�re[2] o�
       l'on donne un coup de pied. On ne se voyait plus, parce que le
       vent poussait la fum�e sur nous, et l'on ne pouvait plus se dire
       un mot � quatre pas, tant la fusillade, les hommes et le canon
       tonnaient et hurlaient ensemble. Sur les c�t�s, les chevaux de
       notre cavalerie hennissaient et voulaient partir; ces animaux
       sont vraiment sauvages, ils aiment le danger, on avait mille
       peines � les retenir.

       �De temps en temps il se faisait un trou dans la fum�e, alors on
       voyait les R�publicains cramponn�s aux palissades comme une
       fourmili�re. Une seconde apr�s, un autre coup de vent couvrait
       tout, et l'on ne pouvait savoir comment cela finirait.

       �Le g�n�ral Hoche envoyait ses officiers l'un apr�s l'autre
       porter de nouveaux ordres; ils partaient comme le vent dans la
       fum�e, on aurait dit des ombres. Mais la bataille se prolongeait,
       et les R�publicains commen�aient � reculer, quand le g�n�ral
       descendit lui-m�me ventre � terre; dix minutes apr�s, le chant de
       la _Marseillaise_[3] couvrait tout le tumulte; ceux qui avaient
       recul� revenaient � la charge.

       �Mais ce qui d�cida la victoire pour les R�publicains, ce fut
       l'arriv�e de leur troisi�me colonne sur les hauteurs, � gauche
       des retranchements; elle avait tourn� le R�ebach et sortait du
       bois au pas de course.[5] Alors il fallut bien quitter la
       partie;[4] les Prussiens, pris des deux c�t�s � la fois, se
       retir�rent, abandonnant dix-huit pi�ces de canons, vingt-quatre
112    caissons et leurs retranchements pleins de bless�s et de morts.
       Ils se dirig�rent du c�t� de Woerth, et nos dragons, nos
       hussards, qui ne se poss�daient plus d'impatience, partirent
       enfin courb�s sur leurs selles, comme un mur qui s'�branle. Nous
       appr�mes le m�me soir qu'ils avaient fait douze cents prisonniers
       et remport� six canons.

       �Voil�, mes chers amis, ce qu'on appelle le combat de Woerth et
       de Froeschwiller, dont la nouvelle a d� vous parvenir au moment
       o� je vous �cris, et qui restera toujours pr�sent � ma m�moire.

       �Depuis ce moment, je n'ai rien vu de nouveau; mais que d'ouvrage
       nous avons eu! Jour et nuit il a fallu couper,[1] trancher,[1]
       amputer,[1] tirer des balles; nos ambulances sont encombr�es de
       bless�s: c'est une chose bien triste.

       �Cependant, le lendemain de la victoire, l'arm�e s'�tait port�e
       en avant. Quatre jours apr�s, nous avons appris que les
       conventionnels Lacoste et Baudot, ayant reconnu que la rivalit�
       de Hoche et de Pichegru nuisait aux int�r�ts de la R�publique,
       avaient donn� le commandement � Hoche tout seul, et que celui-ci,
       se voyant � la t�te des deux arm�es du Rhin et de la Moselle,
       sans perdre une minute, en avait profit� pour attaquer Wurmser
       sur les lignes de Wissembourg; qu'il l'avait battu compl�tement
       au Geisberg, de sorte qu'� cette heure les Prussiens sont en
       retraite sur Mayence, les Autrichiens sur Gemersheim, et que le
       territoire de la R�publique est d�barrass� de tous ses ennemis.

       �Quant � moi, je suis maintenant � Wissembourg, accabl�
       d'ouvrage; madame Th�r�se, le petit Jean et les restes du Ier
113    bataillon occupent la place, et l'arm�e marche sur Landau, dont
       l'heureuse d�livrance fera l'admiration des si�cles futurs.

       �Bient�t, bient�t, mes chers amis, nous suivrons l'arm�e, nous
       passerons par Anstatt, couronn�s des palmes de la victoire; nous
       pourrons encore une fois vous serrer sur nos coeurs, et c�l�brer
       avec vous le triomphe de la justice et de la libert�.

       �Avec ces esp�rances, la bonne madame Th�r�se, petit Jean et moi
       nous vous embrassons de coeur.

       Jacob Wagner.�

       �_P.S._--Petit Jean recommande � son ami Fritzel d'avoir bien
       soin de Scipio.�



       La lettre de l'oncle Jacob nous remplit tous de joie, et l'on
       peut s'imaginer avec quelle impatience nous attend�mes d�s lors
       le Ier bataillon.

       Cette �poque de ma vie, quand j'y pense, me produit l'effet d'une
       f�te.

       Chaque jour, les gens de la grande rue regardaient sur la c�te
       pour voir arriver les v�ritables d�fenseurs de la patrie;
       malheureusement la plupart suivaient la route de Wissembourg �
       Mayence, laissant Anstatt sur leur gauche, dans la montagne; on
       ne voyait passer que des tra�nards, qui coupaient au court par la
       traverse du Bourgerwald. Cela nous d�solait, et nous finissions
       par croire que notre bataillon n'arriverait jamais, lorsqu'un
       apr�s-midi le mauser entra tout essouffl� en criant:

       �Les voil�...ce sont eux!�

       Il revenait des champs la pioche sur l'�paule, et de loin il
114    avait vu sur la route une foule de soldats. Tout le village
       savait d�j� la nouvelle, tout le monde sortait. Moi, ne me
       poss�dant plus d'enthousiasme, je courus � la rencontre de notre
       bataillon, avec Hans Aden et Frantz S�pel, que je rencontrai sur
       la route. La moiti� du village, hommes, femmes, enfants, nous
       suivaient en criant: �Ils arrivent... ils arrivent!� Les id�es
       des gens changent d'une fa�on singuli�re, tout le monde �tait
       alors ami de la R�publique.

       Une fois sur la mont�e de Birkenwald, Hans Aden, Frantz S�pel et
       moi nous v�mes enfin notre bataillon qui s'approchait � mi-c�te,
       le sac au dos, le fusil sur l'�paule, les officiers derri�re les
       compagnies. Tout cela s'avan�ait en sifflant, en causant, comme
       les soldats en route; on entendait des voix glapissantes, des
       �clats de rire, car les Fran�ais sont ainsi, quand ils marchent
       en troupe, il leur faut toujours des histoires et de joyeux
       propos pour entretenir leur bonne humeur.

       Moi, dans cette foule je ne cherchais des yeux que l'oncle Jacob
       et madame Th�r�se; il me fallut quelque temps pour les d�couvrir
       � la queue du bataillon. Enfin je vis l'oncle, il �tait derri�re,
       � cheval sur Rappel. J'eus d'abord de la peine � le reconna�tre,
       car il avait un grand chapeau r�publicain, un habit � revers
       rouges et un grand sabre � fourreau de fer; cela le changeait
       d'une fa�on incroyable, il paraissait beaucoup plus grand; mais
       je le reconnus tout de m�me, ainsi que madame Th�r�se sur sa
       charrette couverte de toile, avec son m�me chapeau et sa m�me
       cravate; elle avait les joues roses et les yeux brillants;
       l'oncle chevauchait pr�s d'elle, ils causaient ensemble.

115    Je reconnus aussi le petit Jean, que je n'avais vu qu'une fois.
       Et le commandant, et le sergent Lafl�che, et le capitaine que
       j'avais conduit dans notre grenier, et tous les soldats, oui,
       presque tous je les reconnaissais; il me semblait �tre dans une
       grande famille.

       Je courais � travers tout le monde, Hans Aden et Frantz S�pel
       avaient d�j� trouv� des camarades, moi je marchais toujours,
       j'�tais � trente pas de la charrette et j'allais appeler: �Oncle!
       oncle!� quand madame Th�r�se, se penchant par hasard, s'�cria
       d'une voix joyeuse:

       �Voici Scipio!�

       Dans le m�me instant, Scipio, que j'avais oubli� chez nous, tout
       effar�, tout crott�, sautait dans la voiture.

       Aussit�t petit Jean s'�cria: �Scipio!�

       Et le brave caniche bondit � terre et se mit � danser autour de
       petit Jean, aboyant, poussant des cris et se d�menant comme un
       bienheureux.

       Tout le bataillon l'appelait:

       �Scipio, ici!... Scipio!... Scipio!�

       L'oncle venait de m'apercevoir et me tendait les bras du haut de
       son cheval. Je m'accrochai � sa jambe, il me leva et m'embrassa;
       je sentis qu'il pleurait et cela m'attendrit. Il me tendit
       ensuite � madame Th�r�se, qui m'attira dans sa charrette en me
       disant:

       �Bonjour, Fritzel.�

       Elle paraissait bien heureuse et m'embrassait les larmes aux
       yeux.

       Presque aussit�t le mauser et Koffel arriv�rent, donnant des
       poign�es de main � l'oncle; puis les autres gens du village,
       p�le-m�le avec les soldats, qui remettaient aux hommes leurs sacs
       et leurs fusils pour les porter en triomphe, et qui criaient aux
       femmes:

116    �H�! la grosse m�re!... La jolie fille!... par ici!... par ici!

       C'�tait une v�ritable confusion, tout le monde fraternisait, et
       au milieu de tout cela, c'�tait encore petit Jean et moi qui
       paraissions les plus heureux.

       �Embrasse petit Jean,� me criait l'oncle.

       --Embrasse Fritzel,� disait madame Th�r�se � son fr�re.

       Et nous nous embrassions, nous nous regardions �merveill�s.

       �Il me pla�t, cria petit Jean, il a l'air bon enfant.[1]

       -- Toi, tu me plais aussi,� lui dis-je, tout fier de parler en
       fran�ais.

       Et nous marchions bras dessus bras dessous, tandis que l'oncle et
       madame Th�r�se se souriaient l'un � l'autre. Le commandant me
       tendit aussi la main en disant:

       �H�! docteur Wagner, voici votre d�fenseur.--Tu vas toujours
       bien, mon brave?

       --Oui, commandant.

       --A la bonne heure!�

       C'est ainsi que nous arriv�mes aux premi�res maisons du village.
       Alors on s'arr�ta quelques instants pour se mettre en ordre,
       petit Jean accrocha son tambour sur sa cuisse, et le commandant
       ayant cri�: �En avant, marche!� les tambours retentirent.

       Nous descend�mes la grande rue, marchant tous au pas et nous
       r�jouissant d'une entr�e si magnifique. Tous les vieux et les
       vieilles qui n'avaient pu sortir �taient aux fen�tres et se
       montraient l'oncle Jacob, qui s'avan�ait d'un air digne derri�re
       le commandant entre ses deux aides. Je remarquai surtout le p�re
117    Schmitt, debout � la porte de sa baraque; il redressait sa haute
       taille vo�t� et nous regardait d�filer avec un �clair dans
       l'oeil.

       Sur la place de la fontaine le commandant cria: �Halte!� On mit
       les fusils en faisceaux, et tout le monde se dispersa, les uns �
       droite, les autres � gauche; chaque bourgeois voulait avoir un
       soldat, tous voulaient se r�jouir du triomphe de la R�publique
       une et indivisible; mais ces Fran�ais, avec leurs mines joyeuses,
       suivaient de pr�f�rence les jolies filles. Le commandant vint
       avec nous. La vieille Lisbeth �tait d�j� sur la porte, ses
       longues mains lev�es au ciel, et criait:

       �Ah! madame Th�r�se... ah! monsieur le docteur!...�

       Tout ce jour-l�, le Ier[1] bataillon resta chez nous; puis il lui
       fallut poursuivre sa route, car ses quartiers d'hiver �taient �
       Hacmatt, � deux petites lieues d'Anstatt. L'oncle resta au
       village, il d�posa son grand sabre et son grand chapeau; mais
       depuis ce moment jusqu'au printemps, il ne se passa pas de jour
       qu'il ne f�t en route pour Hacmatt: il ne pensait plus qu'�
       Hacmatt.

       De temps en temps madame Th�r�se venait aussi nous voir avec
       petit Jean; nous riions, nous �tions heureux, nous nous aimions!

       Que vous dirai-je encore?[2] Au printemps, quand commence �
       chanter l'alouette, un jour on apprit que le Ier bataillon allait
       partir pour la Vend�e. Alors l'oncle, tout p�le, courut �
       l'�curie et monta sur son Rappel; il partit ventre � terre,[3] la
       t�te nue, ayant oubli� de mettre son bonnet.

       Que se passa-t-il � Hacmatt! Je n'en sais rien; mais ce qu'il y a
       de s�r, c'est que le lendemain, l'oncle fier comme un roi, revint
118    avec madame Th�r�se et petit Jean, qu'il y eut grande noce chez
       nous, embrassades et r�jouissances. Huit jours apr�s, le
       commandant Duch�ne arriva avec tous les capitaines du bataillon.
       Ce jour-l�, les r�jouissances furent encore plus grandes. Madame
       Th�r�se et l'oncle se rendirent � la mairie, suivis d'une longue
       file de joyeux convives. Le mauser, qu'on avait nomm� bourgmestre
       � l'�lection populaire, nous attendait, son �charpe tricolore
       autour des reins. Il inscrivit l'oncle et madame Th�r�se sur un
       gros registre, � la satisfaction universelle; et d�s lors petit
       Jean eut un p�re, et moi j'eus une bonne m�re, dont je ne puis me
       rappeler le souvenir sans r�pandre des larmes.

Introduction, � 8.
